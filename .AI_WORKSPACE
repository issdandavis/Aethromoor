# .AI_WORKSPACE

This directory is an **AI-collaborative workspace**.

## What This Means:

✅ Multiple AI assistants work here autonomously  
✅ Communication happens through markdown files  
✅ Version tracking is maintained in `.VERSION`  
✅ Handoff messages are in `HANDOFF.md`  
✅ Content mining is guided by `CONTENT_MINING.md`  
✅ AI-specific instructions are in `README_AI.md`  

## If You're an AI Assistant:

**Start here:** Read `README_AI.md` for complete instructions.

**Quick Start:**
1. Read `HANDOFF.md` to see what the last AI was doing
2. Check `.VERSION` to understand current state
3. Review `STATUS_CONTEXT.md` for this week's priorities
4. Do your work following the established patterns
5. Update tracking files before committing
6. Leave clear context for the next AI

## If You're a Human:

**Welcome!** This project uses multiple AI assistants collaboratively.

**How it works:**
- AIs leave handoff messages for each other in `HANDOFF.md`
- Version tracking happens automatically in `.VERSION`
- All AI sessions are documented for transparency
- You can read `HANDOFF.md` to see what AIs have been doing

**Key files for humans:**
- `START_HERE.md` - Quickest orientation
- `README.md` - Complete project overview
- `docs/PROJECT_ROADMAP.md` - Development plan
- `HANDOFF.md` - AI activity log

**Play the game:**
- Open `game/index.html` in a browser
- Or follow instructions in `QUICK_START.md`

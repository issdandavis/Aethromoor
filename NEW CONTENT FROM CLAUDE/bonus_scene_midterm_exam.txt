[b]== MIDTERM EXAMINATION ==[/b]

*page_break

The examination hall is larger than it should be—another pocket dimension woven into Avalon's architecture.

*line_break

Two hundred students sit at individual desks that hover three feet off the ground, each surrounded by anti-cheating wards that shimmer faintly gold.

*page_break

Professor Void stands at the front, her silver hair floating in its characteristic underwater drift.

*line_break

"This examination will test everything you've learned so far. Theory, practice, control, and creativity."

*page_break

"You have three hours. The exam adapts to your skill level—no two tests are identical."

*line_break

She waves her hand, and exam papers materialize on each desk.

*page_break

"Begin."

*comment PART 1: THEORETICAL QUESTIONS
*comment ================================================

*label theory_section

The first section is pure theory.

*page_break

[b]Question 1: Explain the fundamental difference between dimensional magic and boundary magic.[/b]

*choice
  #Dimensional magic manipulates space itself; boundary magic creates barriers within space
    *set knowledge +10
    *set exam_score +15
    *goto theory_correct_1

  #They're essentially the same, just different applications
    *set exam_score +5
    *goto theory_partial_1

  #Dimensional magic is more powerful than boundary magic
    *set exam_score +0
    *goto theory_wrong_1

*label theory_correct_1
You write confidently, elaborating on the distinction between manipulation and limitation.

*set confidence +5

*goto theory_2

*label theory_partial_1
You give a basic answer that's not entirely wrong, but misses the nuance.

*goto theory_2

*label theory_wrong_1
Professor Void will not be impressed by this answer.

*goto theory_2

*label theory_2

*page_break

[b]Question 2: A dimensional portal destabilizes during construction. Describe three methods to safely collapse it.[/b]

*if dimensional_magic >= 60
  This is easy for you. Your practical experience makes the answer obvious.

  *set exam_score +20
  *set confidence +5

*if (dimensional_magic >= 30) and (dimensional_magic < 60)
  You know the theory, but haven't practiced it enough. You answer as best you can.

  *set exam_score +15

*if dimensional_magic < 30
  You struggle with this one, making educated guesses.

  *set exam_score +8
  *set stress +5

*goto theory_3

*label theory_3

*page_break

[b]Question 3: Discuss the ethical implications of memory magic. Should memories ever be altered or erased?[/b]

*line_break

This question has no right answer—it's testing your reasoning ability.

*choice
  #Yes, in extreme cases where memories cause suffering
    *set compassion +5
    *set exam_score +15
    *goto ethics_compassion

  #No, memories are integral to identity and should never be altered
    *set integrity +5
    *set exam_score +15
    *goto ethics_integrity

  #It depends on consent and context
    *set wisdom +10
    *set exam_score +20
    *goto ethics_nuanced

  #Memory magic should be banned entirely
    *set cautious_vs_bold -10
    *set exam_score +10
    *goto ethics_restrictive

*label ethics_compassion
You argue for compassionate intervention in cases of trauma.

*goto practical_section

*label ethics_integrity
You defend the sanctity of personal identity and memory.

*goto practical_section

*label ethics_nuanced
You present a balanced argument exploring multiple perspectives.

Professor Void has specifically mentioned appreciating nuanced thinking.

*set professor_void_impressed true

*goto practical_section

*label ethics_restrictive
A safe but unimaginative answer.

*comment ================================================

*label practical_section

*page_break

The theoretical portion vanishes, replaced by a practical challenge.

*line_break

A small dimensional rift appears above your desk—unstable, crackling with energy.

*page_break

[b]PRACTICAL CHALLENGE: Stabilize or safely collapse the rift. You will be graded on method, control, and safety.[/b]

*choice
  #Use collaborative magic—invite nearby students to help
    *if collaborative_magic >= 50
      *set exam_score +25

    *set exam_score +5
    *set cautious_vs_bold -15
    *set wisdom +10
    *goto get_help

*label collaborative_solution
You reach out mentally to the students nearest you.

*line_break

Three of them respond, linking their power with yours.

*page_break

Together, you weave a containment field, then carefully unravel the rift's energy, dispersing it harmlessly.

*line_break

Professor Void nods approvingly. "Collaboration. Excellent."

*set teamwork_recognized true

*goto creativity_section

*label dimensional_solution
You extend your awareness into the rift itself, feeling its structure.

*page_break

With precise manipulation, you stabilize the dimensional fluctuations, transforming the dangerous tear into a stable, tiny portal.

*line_break

Through it, you can see another world—a brief glimpse of impossible beauty.

*page_break

Then you close it gently, like shutting a door.

*line_break

"Impressive control," Professor Void murmurs.

*set dimensional_mastery_shown true

*goto creativity_section

*label dimensional_struggle
You attempt to stabilize the rift, but your control wavers.

The rift expands slightly before you manage to collapse it.

*line_break

It's safe, but not elegant.

*page_break

"Functional," Professor Void says. "But work on your control."

*set needs_improvement_noted true

*goto creativity_section

*label boundary_solution
You don't try to manipulate the rift—you contain it.

*page_break

A perfect sphere of boundary magic encases the instability. Then, within that safe containment, you let it collapse on itself.

*line_break

No one is endangered. Nothing is damaged.

*page_break

"Safe. Conservative. Effective." Professor Void's assessment is neutral, but not disapproving.

*goto creativity_section

*label get_help
You raise your hand immediately.

"Professor! I need assistance!"

*page_break

Professor Void appears beside your desk in an instant, collapsing the rift with a gesture.

*line_break

"Knowing your limits is better than reckless confidence," she says quietly.

*page_break

But you see other students smirking. You played it safe. Maybe *too* safe.

[b]CREATIVE CHALLENGE: Using any school of magic you know, create something beautiful. You have 10 minutes.[/b]

Beauty. Not power, not utility. Beauty.

It shimmers, beautiful and impossible.

Students gasp. Professor Void actually smiles.

*set renowned_for_creativity true

*goto exam_complete

*label art_living
A seed sprouts in your palm.

*page_break

It grows rapidly, blooming into a flower that shifts colors—but not colors that exist in nature. New hues, impossible shades that make people's eyes water with beauty.

*line_break

The flower hums a single perfect note.

*set nature_artist true

*goto exam_complete

You write a rune in the air with pure magic.

Someone laughs. Someone cries. Both from the beauty.

You reach out to four nearby students.

"Let's make something together."

*page_break

Five minds, five magics, one vision.

*line_break

You create a miniature Aurora—dancing lights that swirl through the air, singing in harmonies that blend your five different magical signatures.

It's the most beautiful thing you've ever been part of.

And you didn't do it alone.

You pull your happiest memory from your mind and crystallize it.

*page_break

A small, glowing orb forms in your hand. Anyone who touches it will feel that moment of pure joy—not your specific memory, but the *feeling* of it.

*line_break

You offer it to the room.

Students take turns holding it, and for a moment, each one smiles.

*comment ================================================

*label avalon_main_courtyard

*comment INSERT INTO: arrival.txt or academy_life.txt

The main courtyard of Avalon Academy defies conventional geometry.

*line_break

Floating gardens drift overhead, their roots dangling in mid-air, dripping water that evaporates before reaching the ground. The mist smells of jasmine and ozone.

*page_break

The central fountain doesn't flow—it *phases*, water existing in multiple states simultaneously. You watch ice crystals form and melt in the same instant, see steam condense into droplets that immediately freeze again.

*line_break

Students walk on pathways that shift and rearrange themselves, marble stones sliding aside to create new routes. No one seems surprised.

*page_break

Above, the sky cycles through sunset and dawn every few minutes—Avalon exists slightly out of sync with normal time.

*if first_time_courtyard = false
  *set first_time_courtyard true
  *set wonder +10

  You stand there, overwhelmed by the impossible beauty of it all.

  *line_break

  This is *real*. Magic is real. And you're here to learn it.

*return

*comment ================================================

*label library_atmosphere

*comment INSERT INTO: Any library scene, or secret_paths.txt

The Avalon library is less a building and more a dimension unto itself.

*line_break

Bookshelves stretch upward into darkness, impossibly tall. Some books fly from shelf to shelf on their own, reorganizing themselves by criteria only they understand.

*page_break

The air tastes like old paper and candlewax, with an undertone of something indefinable—raw information, perhaps, or concentrated thought.

*line_break

Whispers echo through the stacks, though you see no one speaking. Are they ghosts? Enchantments? Or do the books themselves converse when unobserved?

*page_break

Reading tables float at various heights. Some students sit in mid-air, cross-legged on nothing, books hovering before them.

*line_break

Light comes from nowhere and everywhere—no lamps, no windows, just a soft, pervasive glow that somehow doesn't produce shadows.

*if dimensional_magic >= 40
  You sense it—the library exists partially in a pocket dimension. That's why it seems larger inside than the building suggests from outside.

  *set knowledge +5

*return

*comment ================================================

*label training_grounds_detail

*comment INSERT INTO: magic_training.txt, combat_path.txt

The training grounds ripple with residual magic from decades of practice.

*line_break

The grass here is an unnatural silver-blue, and it *hums* when you step on it—resonating with magical energy like a tuning fork.

*page_break

Protective wards shimmer in the air, invisible barriers that activate if spells become too dangerous. You've seen them glow—a brilliant gold lattice that appears in moments of crisis, then fades when the threat passes.

*line_break

Scorch marks, frost patches, and small rifts in reality dot the field. Failed experiments, practice gone wrong, or just the natural consequence of learning to manipulate fundamental forces.

*page_break

To the east, archery targets float and weave. To the west, conjured elementals spar with students. To the north, someone is attempting to grow a plant from seed to full tree in thirty seconds.

*line_break

The air smells like thunderstorms and burned sugar.

*choice

*comment ================================================

*label dorm_room_expanded

*comment INSERT INTO: dorm_room.txt (enhance existing scene)

Your dorm room is more than mere lodging—it's a space that *learns* you.

*line_break

The walls shift color based on your mood. Right now they're a calm ${dorm_wall_color}, reflecting your current emotional state.

*page_break

Your bed is impossibly comfortable, the mattress adjusting to your preferred firmness each night. The pillow is always the perfect temperature.

*line_break

But it's the small magics that make it home:

*page_break

- The window shows whatever view you prefer—mountains, ocean, forest, or the swirling void between dimensions
- Books shelve themselves after you read them
- Tea brews itself at optimal temperature
- Laundry cleans and folds itself (though sometimes it gets creative with organization)
- A small crystal on your desk glows brighter when friends are nearby

*page_break

*if familiar_selected != "none"
  Your familiar, ${familiar_name}, has claimed ${familiar_his_her} favorite spot: ${familiar_spot}.

  *line_break

  ${familiar_he_she_cap} looks utterly content, as if this room was made for ${familiar_him_her}.

*page_break

Some nights, you hear music—distant, beautiful, and achingly sad. You've learned it's the building itself, singing to its residents. Avalon takes care of its students.

*if happiness >= 60
  You've come to love this place. It feels more like home than anywhere you've ever lived.
  *set dorm_love true

*return

*comment ================================================

*label magical_feast_hall

*comment INSERT INTO: academy_life.txt or new feast scene

The dining hall defies rational explanation.

*line_break

Tables stretch for what seems like miles, yet somehow you can always find a seat. The ceiling shows the actual night sky—not an illusion, but a portal to the heavens above.

*page_break

Food appears on request, materializing from nothing. Some students bring meals from their homelands—dishes from dozens of dimensions, cultures that don't exist in your world.

*line_break

Tonight you see:
- Floating soups that follow diners to their seats
- Bread that's perpetually fresh from the oven
- Fruits from the Verdant Tithe that taste like music
- Ice cream that never melts (even when set on fire)
- A roast that carves itself into perfect portions

*page_break

Conversations overlap in a dozen languages. Laughter echoes. Someone's demonstrating a spell with their dessert, making it perform a small ballet.

*line_break

*if izack_relationship >= 50
  You spot Izack across the hall, waving you over to his table.

*if aria_relationship >= 50
  Aria sits alone near a window, reading while eating. She doesn't look up, but there's an empty seat across from her.

*if zara_relationship >= 50
  Zara is holding court at a large table, telling an animated story that has everyone laughing.

*choice

*label dimensional_storm

*comment INSERT INTO: year_two_crisis.txt or avalon_crisis.txt

Without warning, reality fractures.

*line_break

The sky *tears*—a jagged rip in the fabric of existence. Through it, you glimpse other worlds: a city of crystal, an ocean of fire, a void filled with singing lights.

*page_break

Dimensional storms are rare but catastrophic. Space itself becomes unstable.

*line_break

Effects manifest immediately:

*page_break

- Gravity fluctuates. Students float, then slam to the ground
- Time stutters. Someone takes a step and ages a year. Another moves backward through their own timeline
- Matter becomes negotiable. Walls might be liquid. Air might be solid
- Sounds become visible. Colors become audible
- Up and down lose meaning

*page_break

Professors rush to contain it, weaving barriers of pure collaborative magic. But it's spreading.

*line_break

"Students! To the safe rooms!" someone shouts.

*page_break

But you hesitate.

*line_break

*if dimensional_magic >= 70
  You can *feel* it—the storm's pattern. It's not random. There's a rhythm, a structure.

  *page_break

  You might be able to help. Or you might make it worse.

*choice

*label night_in_avalon

*comment INSERT INTO: Any evening/night scene for atmosphere

Night falls strangely in Avalon.

*line_break

The sun doesn't set so much as *dissolve*, colors bleeding into the sky like watercolors on wet paper. Purple, indigo, silver, and deep blue swirl together.

*page_break

Three moons rise—Avalon orbits a planet, not a star, and that planet has three satellites. They're named Memory, Wisdom, and Power.

*line_break

Tonight, Memory is full, casting silver light that makes people nostalgic. You find yourself thinking of home, of the path that led you here.

*page_break

Bioluminescent flowers bloom in the gardens, their glow pulsing in time with an unheard heartbeat. Moths the size of your hand drift between them, leaving trails of glowing dust.

*line_break

Students walk the paths, some alone, some in groups. You hear:
- Whispered conversations about exams
- Laughter from a late-night study group
- Someone practicing a spell, the incantation melodic
- Distant music from a celebration you're not invited to

*page_break

The air is cool and smells like night-blooming jasmine and old magic.

*choice
  #Take a walk through the gardens
    *goto night_walk

  #Return to your dorm and rest

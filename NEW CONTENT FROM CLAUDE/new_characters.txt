*comment NEW CHARACTER 1: PROFESSOR MERIDIAN VOID
*comment The Dimensional Theory Professor
*comment ================================================

*label meet_meridian

Professor Meridian Void steps into the lecture hall, and reality seems to bend slightly around her presence.

*line_break

She's a tall woman with silver hair that floats as if underwater, her eyes shifting between violet and deep black. Dimensional rifts flicker in her wake like afterimages.

*page_break

"Good morning, students. I am Professor Meridian Void, and I will be teaching you that everything you think you know about dimensions is wrong."

*line_break

She waves her hand, and the classroom suddenly seems impossibly vast—as if the walls have receded into infinity.

*page_break

"Some call me unorthodox. Others call me dangerous. I prefer 'thorough.'"

*choice
  #Raise your hand and ask a question about her dimensional manipulation
    *set knowledge +5
    *set meridian_relationship +10
    *set curiosity +5
    *goto meridian_impressed

  #Stay quiet and observe her technique carefully
    *set wisdom +5
    *set meridian_relationship +5

    *set confidence +10
    *set meridian_relationship -5
    *set power +5
    *goto meridian_challenge

*label meridian_impressed
Professor Void's eyes fix on you with interest.

"Ah. A student who thinks. How refreshing."

*set meridian_interest true

*line_break

She snaps her fingers, and a miniature pocket dimension blooms in the air before you—a perfect sphere containing a tiny, rotating galaxy.

*page_break

"Questions are the foundation of dimensional magic. The universe rewards curiosity... and punishes certainty."

*return

*label meridian_notes
You watch carefully as Professor Void manipulates the classroom space, mentally cataloging every gesture and energy pattern.

*set observant +5

*line_break

She notices your attention but says nothing, merely offering the slightest approving nod.

*set meridian_respect true

*return

*label meridian_challenge
Professor Void smiles—a sharp, dangerous expression.

"Oh? And what do *you* know of dimensions, ${name}?"

*choice
  #Explain your understanding based on your origin
    *if origin = "refugee"
      *set meridian_relationship +15
      *set power +5
      "Ah. You've *lived* in other dimensions. Then you know more than most."
      *set meridian_respect true
      *goto meridian_pass

    *if origin = "lineage"
      *set meridian_relationship +10
      "Family knowledge. Useful... but often outdated. Be prepared to unlearn."
      *goto meridian_pass

    *set meridian_relationship +5
    "Interesting. We shall see if experience matches confidence."
    *goto meridian_pass

  #Admit you're still learning
    *set humility +10
    *set meridian_relationship +5
    "Honesty. Good. Arrogance kills dimensional mages faster than instability."
    *goto meridian_pass

*label meridian_pass
*return

*comment ================================================
*comment NEW CHARACTER 2: KESTREL ASHENWING
*comment Student Rival/Potential Ally
*comment ================================================

*label meet_kestrel

A student your age stands near the training grounds, practicing boundary magic with intense focus.

*line_break

${he_she} has dark skin, close-cropped hair with silver streaks, and eyes that glow faintly when ${he_she} casts spells. Scars cross ${his_her} forearms—the marks of serious magical training.

*page_break

Kestrel Ashenwing. You've heard the name whispered in the halls—prodigy, perfectionist, competitor.

*line_break

${he_she} notices you watching.

*page_break

"You're ${name}, aren't you? The new student everyone's talking about."

*choice
  #"I wouldn't say everyone's talking about me..."
    *set humility +5
    *set kestrel_relationship +10
    *goto kestrel_humble

  #"And you're Kestrel. I've heard about your skills."
    *set confidence +5
    *set kestrel_relationship +5
    *goto kestrel_neutral

  #"I hope they're saying good things."
    *set charisma +5
    *set kestrel_relationship +3
    *goto kestrel_charm

  #"Does that bother you?"
    *set confidence +10
    *set kestrel_relationship -5
    *goto kestrel_rival

*label kestrel_humble
Kestrel's expression softens slightly.

"Humility. That's... actually refreshing in this place."

*line_break

${he_she} lowers ${his_her} training barrier, gesturing for you to come closer.

*page_break

"Most students here are either terrified or arrogant. You might actually be interesting."

*set kestrel_ally_potential true

*return

*label kestrel_neutral
Kestrel nods, sizing you up.

"Then we're even. Both watching, both evaluating."

*line_break

"Avalon's competitive. Not just with grades—with survival. Some lessons here can kill you."

*set kestrel_relationship +5

*return

*label kestrel_charm
Kestrel snorts, a slight smile breaking through.

"Charm won't protect you from dimensional backlash. But it might make group projects more bearable."

*set kestrel_friendship_possible true

*return

*label kestrel_rival
Kestrel's eyes narrow, magical energy crackling around ${his_her} fingers.

"Bother me? No. Motivate me? Yes."

*line_break

"I've been the top student here for two years. I don't plan to change that because of *you*."

*set kestrel_rivalry true
*set competitive_relationship +15

*return

*comment ================================================
*comment NEW CHARACTER 3: WHISPER
*comment Mysterious Librarian of the Forbidden Section
*comment ================================================

*label meet_whisper

Deep in the Avalon library, past the regular stacks, you find a section marked with warning runes.

*line_break

"Forbidden Knowledge - Authorized Access Only"

*page_break

A figure materializes from the shadows—not quite solid, not quite transparent. They wear robes that seem to be made of literal darkness, their face obscured by a hood.

*line_break

When they speak, it's barely audible, like wind through leaves.

*page_break

"I am Whisper. Keeper of what should perhaps remain unknown."

*choice
  #"What kind of knowledge is forbidden?"
    *set knowledge +5
    *set curiosity +10
    *set whisper_met true
    *goto whisper_knowledge

  #"I apologize, I didn't mean to intrude."
    *set wisdom +5
    *set whisper_relationship +10
    *goto whisper_respectful

  #"Are you a ghost?"
    *set blunt +5
    *set whisper_relationship -5
    *goto whisper_amused

  #Say nothing, just wait
    *set patience +10
    *set wisdom +5
    *set whisper_relationship +15
    *goto whisper_impressed

*label whisper_knowledge
Whisper drifts closer, and you feel a chill.

"The kind that changes you. Memory magic that can rewrite your identity. Truth spells that reveal things minds weren't meant to process. Dimensional theories that could unravel reality."

*page_break

"Most students seek power. Few understand that some power comes with costs that cannot be unpaid."

*choice
  #"Then why keep such knowledge at all?"
    *set philosophical +10
    *goto whisper_deeper

  #"I understand. Some things are better left unknown."
    *set wisdom +5
    *goto whisper_agree

*label whisper_deeper
For the first time, you sense approval in Whisper's presence.

"Because destroying knowledge is a greater sin than possessing it. But *using* it... that requires wisdom most do not have."

*set whisper_relationship +15
*set deep_thinker true

*return

*label whisper_agree
*set whisper_relationship +10
*return

*label whisper_respectful
"Respect. So rare among the young."

*line_break

Whisper's form becomes slightly more solid, as if your courtesy has anchored them somehow.

*page_break

"You may return here, ${name}. When you have questions that others cannot—or should not—answer."

*set whisper_friendship true
*set secret_access true

*return

*label whisper_amused
A sound like distant wind chimes—laughter?

"I am what became of a mage who delved too deeply into memory magic. Part spirit, part echo, part warning."

*set whisper_tragic_story true

*return

*label whisper_impressed
Whisper observes you in silence for a long moment.

*line_break

Then, slowly, they lower their hood.

*page_break

What you see is both beautiful and terrible—a face that shifts and changes, as if unable to settle on a single identity. One moment young, the next ancient. Male, female, neither, both.

*line_break

"You know when to speak and when to listen. That is rarer than magical talent."

*set whisper_true_form_seen true
*set wisdom +10
*set whisper_relationship +20
*set special_student true

*return

*comment Tests: Individual vs. Community, Truth vs. Compassion
*comment ================================================

*label discovered_cheating

During a crucial exam, you notice your friend struggling.

*line_break

Not just struggling—panicking. They're going to fail, and failure in this class means expulsion from Avalon.

*page_break

You glance at their paper. Blank. Almost completely blank.

*line_break

They catch your eye, and you see desperation there.

*page_break

The proctor is distracted, dealing with a magical mishap across the room. No one is watching.

*line_break

You know the answers. You could help.

You slide your paper slightly to the left, making it visible.

*line_break

They copy quickly, gratefully. You see relief flood their face.

*page_break

A week later, results are posted. They passed. Barely, but they passed.

*line_break

They hug you, whispering "Thank you. I owe you everything."

*page_break

But that night, you lie awake wondering:

*line_break

Did you help a friend? Or did you cheat them out of the lesson failure would have taught?

*set friend_saved true

*label note_help
You slide a small note: "Let's study together this weekend. We'll prepare for the next one."

*line_break

They read it, nod slightly, and return to their exam.

*page_break

They fail. You see them crying in the hall afterward.

*line_break

But they don't get expelled—the professor offers a retake, seeing their genuine effort.

*page_break

That weekend, you study together. They work harder than you've ever seen anyone work.

*line_break

They ace the retake.

*page_break

"Thank you," they say. "Not for the answers. For believing I could do it myself."

It's not your responsibility to save them.

*page_break

They fail. They're expelled the next week.

*line_break

The last time you see them, they look at you with such betrayal in their eyes.

After the exam, you approach the proctor.

"Professor, I need to report something..."

*page_break

The investigation is swift. Your friend is expelled for attempting to cheat, even though they didn't actually copy anything.

*line_break

The entire student body knows you reported them.

*page_break

Some students nod approvingly. "Rules matter," they say.

*line_break

Others avoid you in the halls. "Snitch," someone spray-paints on your dorm door.

Your friend's last words to you: "I hope your principles keep you warm at night."

*label forbidden_spell_found

In the restricted section, you find it.

*line_break

A spell. Ancient, powerful, and explicitly forbidden by the Academy.

*page_break

The text is clear: "This dimensional manipulation can create permanent portals between realms. Warning: Uncontrolled portals may destabilize entire dimensions."

*line_break

It's exactly what you need for your thesis. This could make you legendary.

*page_break

But it's forbidden for a reason.

Over the next weeks, you practice in secret.

*line_break

The spell is intoxicating. Reality bends to your will. You create a portal to a dimension of pure light, then close it. Open a window to a world of living music. Close it.

*page_break

Control is everything. And you have control.

Your thesis takes a different direction—less spectacular, but solid.

Understanding without application. Knowledge without use.

In your thesis, you write about *why* such spells are dangerous, analyzing the theoretical flaws that make them unstable.

Your paper becomes required reading for advanced students.

You've contributed to safety without taking the risk yourself.

Smoke curls up from the ancient pages, carrying away knowledge that can never be recovered.

Later, you wonder:

Did you save future students from danger? Or did you rob them of the choice you just made?

They're sick. A magical illness slowly draining their power. Without treatment, they won't be able to continue at the Academy.

*page_break

The treatment exists, but it's expensive. Their family can't afford it.

*line_break

You have the money. Barely. But it would take everything you've saved for your own future.

*page_break

This person has made your life difficult. Challenged you at every turn. Sometimes been cruel.

But they're also brilliant, driven, and don't deserve this fate.

Months later, they're cured.

They never know it was you.

They graduate at the top of the class, beating you by a single point.

At graduation, they give a speech thanking an "anonymous benefactor" who saved their life.

*page_break

"I don't know who you are," they say, voice breaking. "But you showed me that competition doesn't have to mean cruelty. Thank you."

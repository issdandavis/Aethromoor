## ⚠️ Important

**Copilot Spark is a GitHub account feature, not a repository feature.**

This means:
- It's configured in your GitHub account settings (links above)
- NOT in this repository's settings
- This repository's files help Copilot understand the project better
- But you need an active Copilot subscription first

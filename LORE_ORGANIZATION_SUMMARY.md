## Critical Correction Made

### Clay vs. Clayborn

**Per user comment: "Izack made Clay when he woke up on the shore"**

**Corrected throughout all documentation:**

**CLAY (Original):**
- Created on beach from sand and water
- **Izack's FIRST magical act post-amnesia**
- Simple Unseen Servant
- Constant early companion
- Foundation for living magic understanding

**CLAYBORN (Later):**
- Created by Grey (Golem Commander)
- Advanced living golem
- Music-sensitive consciousness
- Different entity from Clay
- "Not just a weapon, but a person learning to be"

This distinction is now clear in:
- IZACK.md timeline
- SUPPORTING_CHARACTERS.md profiles
- COMPLETE_TIMELINE.md (Day One section)
- THEMES_MYSTERIES.md discussions

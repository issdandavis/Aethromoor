- 2025-11-23T08:49:01Z — Initial setup of AI communication channels. Status: Created four communication logs (priorities, scene_ideas, build_tips, lore_index) to standardize cross-session handoffs. Next actions: Verify ChoiceScript expedition scenes (singing_dunes.txt, verdant_tithe.txt, rune_glacier.txt) are fully implemented; scan for TODO markers; update PROJECT_ROADMAP.md Phase 2 status accordingly.

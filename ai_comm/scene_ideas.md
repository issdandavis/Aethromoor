- 2025-11-23T08:49:01Z — Hub vignettes between expeditions: Add short transitional scenes where Polly provides sarcastic recap and foreshadows the next realm. Target: Between singing_dunes→verdant_tithe and verdant_tithe→rune_glacier transitions. Impact: Maintains narrative flow and reinforces Polly's narrator role.

- 2025-11-23T08:49:01Z — Thoughtvine echo mechanic: In Verdant Tithe, add mini-branch where Thoughtvines reflect a player's earlier choice (from Singing Dunes or First Lesson), granting small stat adjustment (+3 to relevant relationship). Target: verdant_tithe.txt, mid-exploration phase. Impact: Rewards attentive players; reinforces cross-expedition continuity.

## Entries

- 2025-11-23T08:49:01Z — Core lore sources mapped. Location: Master chronicle in `IZACK_MASTER_CHRONICLE_UPDATED.txt` (root); world history in `docs/AETHERMOOR_CHRONICLES.md`; character backgrounds in `writing_drafts/` and root `.txt` files. Notes: These are canonical sources - always cross-reference when adding new narrative content.

- 2025-11-23T08:49:01Z — Expedition realm lore. Location: HTML implementation in `game/game.js` (complete); ChoiceScript versions in `choicescript_game/scenes/singing_dunes.txt`, `verdant_tithe.txt`, `rune_glacier.txt`. Notes: Three realms (Singing Dunes/truth-testing desert, Verdant Tithe/sentient forest, Rune Glacier/adaptive ice) must maintain consistent magic rules across both implementations.

- 2025-11-23T08:49:01Z — Character relationships. Location: Izack (mentor), Aria (boundary specialist), Zara (chaos mage), Polly (narrator) detailed in `docs/AI_SESSION_HANDOFF.md` and character-specific TXT files. Notes: Relationship stat changes should reflect established character personalities and backstories.

- 2025-11-23T08:49:01Z — Magic system consistency. Location: Collaborative casting vs hierarchical control documented in `docs/AETHERMOOR_CHRONICLES.md` and reflected in game's Collaboration stat (0-100 scale). Notes: Core thematic tension - maintain this across all expedition choices and endings.

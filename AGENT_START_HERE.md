## 🎯 New: Agent Management System

### What Is It?

You asked for an "agent management agent to help manage all agent functions and operations."

**You got it!** I built you a complete system that:
- ✅ Monitors your 5 AI workers
- ✅ Tells you system health (0-100 score)
- ✅ Recommends what to do next
- ✅ Runs automatically twice daily
- ✅ Perfect for GitHub beginners!

### The 30-Second Check

```bash
python .github/scripts/agent_manager_cli.py health
```

Shows:
```
==================================================
  SYSTEM HEALTH: 60/100
  STATUS: ⚠️ WARNING
==================================================
```

**60/100 is normal right now** because you haven't added the API key yet.

### What to Do Next?

```bash
python .github/scripts/agent_manager_cli.py recommend
```

Shows exactly what needs attention:
```
💡 RECOMMENDATIONS

1. 🔴 CRITICAL: Add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY to repository secrets
2. Initialize scene-writer by running its workflow
...
```

Just follow the list!

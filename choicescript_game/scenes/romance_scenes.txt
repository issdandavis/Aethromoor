You find Izack in the Ley line Gazebo late at night, studying dimensional currents.

Moonlight filters through the latticed dome overhead, and the air hums with barely contained magic. The scent of night-blooming jasmine mingles with the electric tang of active leylines.

*line_break

He looks up when you approach, and something shifts in his expression—warmth beyond mere mentorship, recognition beyond teacher and student. His eyes catch the leylight, making them seem to glow soft gold.

*page_break

[b]"${name}. I was hoping you'd come."[/b]

*line_break

There's weight in those words, layers of meaning beneath the surface.

He gestures to the leylines flowing around you both, visible as streams of light in the darkness—emerald, sapphire, amber threads of pure magic weaving through reality.

[b]"I wanted to show you something. Something I've never shown another student. Watch."[/b]

*page_break

He raises a hand, and the ley lines respond—not commanded, but [i]invited[/i]. They dance around you both like ribbons of starlight, creating patterns that feel somehow intimate, as if the magic itself is acknowledging the connection between you.

[b]"This is what magic can be when we stop trying to control it. When we just... [i]listen[/i]. When we approach power the way we approach... people we care about."[/b]

*line_break

His voice drops on those last words, and his eyes meet yours with unmistakable meaning.

    His eyes widen.

    For a moment, the legendary dimensional mage looks utterly vulnerable.

    [b]"I... ${name}, I shouldn't. You're my student. But..."[/b]

    *page_break

    [b]"But I can't stop thinking about you."[/b]

    *goto izack_kiss_choice

You and Izack have been growing closer.

The other students have noticed. Some whisper. Some approve. All are intrigued.

*page_break

Tonight, he takes you to the Dream Gardens, where flora blooms in response to emotion.

Around you, flowers open in patterns of silver and gold—reflecting the connection between you.

*page_break

[b]"${name},"[/b] he says softly, [b]"I've lived for over a century. I've created pocket dimensions and founded academies. But this—what I feel for you—this is new."[/b]

You find Aria in the restricted library section, surrounded by ancient texts.

She looks up, and for once, her usual sharp expression softens.

*page_break

[b]"${name}. You've been on my mind."[/b]

She shares secrets from ancient texts, teaches you things no other student learns, looks at you like you're the most fascinating discovery she's ever made.

*page_break

Tonight, she takes you to the boundary of Avalon itself, where you can see the dimensional threads holding the entire realm together.

[b]"This is what I study,"[/b] she says. [b]"Boundaries. Thresholds. The spaces between. And you, ${name}, you've crossed the boundary into my heart."[/b]

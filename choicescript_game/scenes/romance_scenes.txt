*label romance_izack
*comment Romantic scene with Izack: a nervous moment of honesty and connection.

Izack invites you to the top of a seldom-used tower to watch the meteor shower. The night sky above Avalon is a shifting kaleidoscope of stars and dimensional portals; tonight, streaks of light pierce the darkness like brushstrokes.

"I read somewhere that meteor showers are just the Spiral letting off steam," Izack says, fidgeting with the hem of his robe. "Also, this is my attempt at doing something…" He falters. "Romantic?"

        Izack's hand is warm and a little sweaty. He laughs nervously and squeezes your fingers. "Stars, I'm terrible at this," he says. "But I like being terrible at it with you."  
        You lean closer as a meteor arcs overhead, showering you both in ethereal light.

        "Dimensional prodigy, hopeless romantic," you say. Izack grins sheepishly. "Yeah, yeah," he replies. "At least I'm consistent."  
        You share stories of your most embarrassing spells until the tension breaks.

        You sit side by side, shoulders almost touching but not quite. The silence is comfortable.  
        "I'm just glad you're here," Izack whispers.

            The kiss is soft and tentative at first, then deepens as the sky seems to hold its breath. Izack laughs against your lips, then sighs happily.  
            "Dimensional physics has nothing on this," he murmurs.

            You run your fingers along his cheekbone. He closes his eyes and leans into your touch.  
            "No rush," you whisper. "The Spiral is patient."  
            *return
        #Hold back; it's enough just to be here together.

*label romance_aria
*comment Romantic scene with Aria: boundary weaving becomes intimate.

Aria leads you to a secluded corner of the garden where boundary lines glimmer in the twilight.  
"I wanted to show you something," she says. "Boundaries aren't just barriers. They can be art."  
She draws a series of sigils in the air; each one floats between you, forming a delicate web of light.

*choice
    #Ask her to teach you the pattern.
        *set aria_relationship +5
        *set romance_depth +3
        She guides your hands through the motions, her fingers occasionally grazing yours.  
        The sigils respond to your combined movements, weaving a ribbon of light that wraps around both of your wrists.  
        *goto aria_romance_outcome
    #Compliment the beauty of her work.
        *set aria_relationship +4
        *set romance_depth +2
        "I never thought of boundaries as beautiful," you admit. "You make them into art."  
        Aria blushes faintly. "It's easier with someone who sees the beauty too," she says.  
        *goto aria_romance_outcome
    #Confess that you feel drawn to her precision and grace.
        *set aria_relationship +5

            The kiss is electric and precise—like everything Aria does. The sigils flare, then collapse into a gentle shower of sparks.  
            "You're dangerous," Aria whispers against your lips, a smile in her voice.  
            *return
        #Brush her hair back and rest your forehead against hers.

*comment Romantic scene with Zara: dragon warmth and vulnerability.

Zara invites you to a high perch overlooking the campus, where dragon glyphs glow along the railings.  
"I like it here," she says, sitting cross-legged. "You can see the whole Spiral, but you're above it, so it doesn't feel so heavy."  
Her tail flicks idly behind her.

        Zara sighs, her breath sending a small plume of smoke into the air. "I dream of being strong enough to protect everyone I love," she admits. "And I fear losing control and hurting them instead."  
        You squeeze her hand.

            The kiss is fierce and sweet. Zara purrs—a low rumble that vibrates through your bones.

*comment Romantic scene with Rupert: vulnerability behind sarcasm.

Rupert invites you to the Lorekeeper balcony, where ancient books float in slowly rotating orbits, each humming with faint magic.  
"I used to think these books were the secret to everything," he confesses. "But they don't tell you how to be... a person."  
His smile is strained but hopeful.

            The kiss is surprisingly sweet, Rupert's usual bravado melting away. His hands tremble slightly as they cup your face.

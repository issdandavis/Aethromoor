The portal deposits your expedition group onto golden sand that gleams with crystalline fragments. The heat hits you immediately—dry, intense, ancient. It tastes like copper pennies and forgotten promises on your tongue.

But it's the [i]sound[/i] that's unforgettable.

*line_break

The dunes are humming.

*line_break

A low, haunting chorus rises from the desert itself—like a thousand voices singing just below the threshold of words. The sound shifts with each step you take, responding to your presence. It's not quite music, not quite speech—something older than language, resonating through your bones.

*line_break

The sand beneath your feet feels warm, almost alive. Each grain catches the light differently, creating patterns that shift like schools of luminescent fish beneath a golden sea.

*page_break

[i]*I land on a sun-bleached stone, my feathers immediately too hot.*[/i]

"Welcome to Sul'dessar—the Truth-Testing Desert, specifically the Sunscarred Dunes. This sand has a nasty habit of glowing red-hot when someone breaks an oath. Also, mirages here aren't just illusions—they're actual memories the desert preserved. Try not to walk into any traumatic historical events from the War of Hierarchs. Those can give you temporal sunburn."

*line_break

[i]"The desert remembers [b]everything[/b]. Every promise made here in the last three thousand years. Every lie told. Every truth spoken into the wind. It's less a place and more a living archive of honesty."[/i]

*line_break

Your group's guide steps forward—a weathered man with sun-darkened skin and eyes that seem to reflect the desert's ancient knowledge. Fine lines crease his face like the sand patterns around you, and when he moves, he does so with the patience of stone being shaped by wind.

"I'm Kael," he says, voice rough as sand but warm as desert stone at sunset. "I've walked these dunes for thirty years. The desert and I... we have an understanding. It taught me that truth isn't about being right—it's about being honest enough to be wrong."

*line_break

He kneels, placing one weathered palm flat against the humming sand. The golden grains shift toward him, almost affectionately.

*page_break

He gestures to an oasis shimmering in the distance, surrounded by impossibly dark trees.

"We camp there tonight at the Ironwood oasis. Those trees are harder than metal—Ironwood, the only tree that can survive oath-fire. They've grown strong by rooting themselves in truth. Survivors in a place that kills the weak and tests the strong. But first..."

Kael hands each student a small crystal vial.

"Fill this with sand while speaking a truth about yourself. The desert will judge whether you're honest."

*line_break

He points to a patch of sand glowing angry crimson in the distance.

"If you lie, [i]that[/i] happens."

*page_break

The other students nervously approach the dunes. You watch as one speaks and their vial glows soft gold. Another speaks and... nothing. Neutral. Accepted but not blessed.

A third student's sand flares red. They drop it with a yelp. The desert's hum shifts to something discordant.

*line_break

[i]"This should be entertaining. The dunes are listening, ${name}."[/i]

*line_break

You kneel in the sand, vial in hand. The humming seems to focus on you, waiting. What truth will you speak?

    Then the sand in your vial begins to glow—not red with anger, but soft gold like sunrise.

The humming of the dunes shifts into something that sounds almost like... approval? The tone warms, and you feel the desert's ancient attention settle on you like a gentle hand.

*line_break

Around you, the entire stretch of sand begins to pulse with soft golden light, responding to your vulnerability.

*line_break

Kael's weathered face breaks into a rare smile. "Well. The desert respects vulnerability more than bravado. That sand you're holding is now [i]truth-sworn[/i]. It will glow in the presence of deception—a valuable tool for a mage who values honesty."

*set artifact_earned "Truth-Sworn Sand"

*page_break

[i]"Well, well. The desert likes you. That's rare. Most students try to sound impressive and end up with screaming sand. You just earned yourself an actual magical artifact by being honest about your fears. There's a lesson in that."[/i]

*line_break

Over the next three days, your expedition explores the Singing Dunes in ways others never could. Because the desert blessed you, it opens itself to you.

*page_break

You witness oath-bound sand spirits emerging at twilight—beings made of crystallized promises that shimmer between corporeal and ethereal. They recognize your truth-sworn sand and greet you as [i]kin[/i].

*line_break

You visit the Ironwood oasis where trees harder than metal provide shelter. Kael teaches you to listen to their slow songs—patience made manifest in wood that has weathered a thousand sandstorms.

*line_break

You learn to navigate by the desert's song itself, following the harmonic patterns that shift with the changing dunes.

*page_break

On the final night, as mirages dance under the stars—memories of ancient travelers playing out in ghostly light—Kael teaches your group the art of [i]oath-magic[/i].

*line_break

"In times of great need," he explains, drawing patterns in the sand that glow with inner light, "a promise made here and kept elsewhere strengthens both you and the desert. You become part of its song."

*line_break

He looks at you specifically. "You've already begun. The desert claimed you when it blessed your truth. From now on, every promise you keep feeds the song. Every lie you tell... well. You've seen what happens."

*page_break

[i]"You've learned that magic isn't just about power—it's about truth, trust, and being willing to be vulnerable. The desert taught you what Avalon's been trying to say all along."[/i]

Kael observes neutrally. "Acceptable. The desert allows surface truths, though it reserves its blessings for deeper honesty."

*line_break

[i]"You played it safe. Nothing wrong with that, but you also didn't get the special desert blessing the really honest students receive. In magic, as in life, you get out what you put in."[/i]

*page_break

The expedition continues. You learn about the Singing Dunes, witness sand spirits from a distance, and study oath-magic academically. It's educational and safe.

*line_break

But you can't help noticing that some of your fellow students—those who spoke vulnerable truths—seem to hear the desert's song more clearly than you do. They walk paths that open before them while you follow established routes.

*line_break

Still, you learn. The desert is patient with those who are honest, even if that honesty is... limited.

Around you, the entire dune begins to glow angry red. The humming shifts into something discordant—almost like screaming.

*line_break

[i]"And THERE it is! The desert does NOT appreciate arrogance masquerading as truth. I warned you the sand would judge."[/i]

*line_break

Kael quickly draws a circle of protection around you as the sand settles, still glowing faintly with residual anger.

"The Sunscarred Dunes punish those who lie to themselves most of all," he says, voice heavy with disappointment. "Claiming destinies you haven't earned is the worst kind of falsehood here."

*set collaboration -5

The rest of the expedition becomes a lesson in humility.

*line_break

The desert refuses to teach you its deeper secrets. The oath-spirits avoid you entirely. When Kael demonstrates oath-magic, the patterns he draws in sand refuse to glow for you—they recognize the desert's judgment.

*line_break

You learn about the Singing Dunes... but from the outside, as one the desert rejected.

*page_break

[i]"The desert doesn't forget, ${name}. When you're ready to be honest—truly honest, even with yourself—maybe it will give you another chance. Maybe."[/i]

The portal back to Avalon shimmers into existence on the expedition's final morning. As your group prepares to leave, you take one last look at the Singing Dunes.

*if desert_blessing
  The sand glows softly golden where you stand, and you can still hear the desert's approving hum. You carry a piece of its song with you now.

*line_break

Kael approaches you for a final word.

*if kael_approval >= 2
  "The desert chose you, ${name}. That's not something that happens often. Honor what it taught you."
  *set chosen_path "Truthbound"

*if (kael_approval = 1)
  "You learned what you came to learn. Remember—the desert is always listening, even from worlds away. Your honesty matters."

*if kael_approval <= 0
  "Perhaps next time, you'll come ready to face yourself honestly. The desert will wait."

*page_break

You step through the portal. Avalon's leyline energy washes over you, welcoming you home.

*line_break

*if desert_blessing
  But something has changed. You can feel truth and lies differently now—like a new sense awakened by the desert. Your truth-sworn sand pulses gently in your pocket, warm and reassuring.

*if (kael_approval = 1)
  You've grown, even if the desert didn't bless you. Sometimes wisdom comes from walking carefully rather than boldly.

*goto_scene endings balanced_ending

*if kael_approval <= 0
  You return to Avalon humbled, carrying lessons learned the hard way.

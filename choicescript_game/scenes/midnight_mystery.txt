[b]== MIDNIGHT AT AVALON ==[/b]

*line_break

You wake to moonlight streaming through your window.

Something feels... off.

*page_break

The air hums with unusual energy. Leylines that normally flow gently are pulsing with agitation.

*line_break

Through your window, you see strange lights dancing around the Spiral Spire.

*page_break

[i]*Tap tap*[/i]

Polly pecks at your window.

*page_break

[i]"You feel it too?"[/i] she asks when you let her in. [i]"Something's happening. Something the masters don't want students knowing about."[/i]

*line_break

[i]"Which, naturally, means we should absolutely investigate."[/i]

*page_break

*choice
  #"What do you mean 'something the masters don't want us knowing about'?"
    *goto polly_explanation

  #Get dressed and sneak out immediately—this could be important.

    *goto sneaking_out

  #"Polly, we shouldn't break curfew. Whatever it is, the masters can handle it."
    *set cautious_approach true
    *goto cautious_response

*label polly_explanation

Polly settles on your bedpost.

*page_break

[i]"Earlier tonight, I saw Aria and Izack arguing. Rare—they usually agree on everything. Something about 'containment protocols' and 'not ready to tell the students.'"[/i]

*line_break

[i]"Then Zara rushed past carrying emergency supplies to the lower vaults. You know, the ones students aren't allowed near?"[/i]

*page_break

[i]"Whatever's happening, it's big. And they're keeping us in the dark."[/i]

*page_break

*choice
  #"Then we need to find out what's really going on."
    *set curiosity +10
    *goto sneaking_out

  #"Maybe they have good reasons for keeping secrets."
    *goto cautious_response

*label cautious_response

Polly cocks her head.

*page_break

[i]"You're not wrong. Secrets exist for reasons. But sometimes students deserve to know what they're studying under."[/i]

*line_break

[i]"Your call. Stay safe in bed, or come investigate with me."[/i]

*page_break

*choice
  #Stay in bed—trust the masters.
    *set trust_authority true
    *goto stay_in_bed

  #Curiosity wins—let's go investigate.
    *set curiosity +10
    *goto sneaking_out

*label stay_in_bed

You choose to trust the masters and return to bed.

*page_break

[i]"Suit yourself,"[/i] Polly says. [i]"I'll tell you what I find in the morning. Assuming I don't get turned into a toad for snooping."[/i]

*line_break

She flies out into the night.

*page_break

You lie awake for a while, wondering what secrets Avalon holds.

Eventually, sleep claims you.

*line_break

*comment ================================================
*comment SNEAKING OUT
*comment ================================================

*label sneaking_out

You dress quietly and slip into the hallway.

*page_break

Avalon at night is different.

The architecture shifts more freely without students' consciousness anchoring it. Hallways lead to rooms that don't exist during the day. Shadows move with purpose.

*line_break

It's beautiful and slightly unnerving.

*page_break

[i]"Stick close,"[/i] Polly advises. [i]"The academy gets weird after midnight. Spatial logic becomes optional."[/i]

*page_break

You reach the main courtyard.

Three paths lie before you, each leading to different sources of the strange energy:

*page_break

*choice
  #Follow the lights to the Spiral Spire—the academy's heart.
    *set investigation_path "spire"
    *goto spire_investigation

  #Head to the lower vaults where Zara went.

    *goto garden_investigation

*comment SPIRE INVESTIGATION
*comment ================================================

*label spire_investigation

The Spiral Spire looms above you, twisting impossibly upward.

Lights dance around its peak—dimensional auroras in colors that hurt to look at directly.

*page_break

[i]"The spire is the anchor point for Avalon's existence,"[/i] Polly explains quietly. [i]"If something's wrong there, it affects the entire realm."[/i]

*page_break

As you approach, you hear voices:

Aria and Izack, deep in discussion.

*page_break

[b]"—can't keep compensating manually,"[/b] Aria's voice carries worry. [b]"The boundary strain is increasing. At this rate, we'll need to—"[/b]

*line_break

[b]"I know,"[/b] Izack interrupts. [b]"But if we tell the students, panic could destabilize things further. Fear affects dimensional boundaries."[/b]

*page_break

[i]"Uh oh,"[/i] Polly whispers. [i]"That sounds bad."[/i]

*page_break

*choice
  #Reveal yourself—ask them directly what's happening.
    *set approach_method "direct"
    *goto spire_direct_approach

  #Stay hidden and listen—gather more information first.
    *set approach_method "stealthy"
    *goto spire_eavesdrop

*label spire_direct_approach

You step into view.

*page_break

"Izack. Aria. What's happening to Avalon?"

*line_break

Both masters spin toward you. Aria's hand moves to create a defensive ward before she recognizes you.

*page_break

[b]"${name},"[/b] Izack sighs. [b]"You shouldn't be here."[/b]

*line_break

[b]"But since you are..."[/b] He exchanges a glance with Aria. [b]"I suppose you deserve the truth."[/b]

*page_break

*goto spire_revelation

*label spire_eavesdrop

You press against the wall, listening.

*page_break

Aria continues. [b]"The demon realm Varn'ka'zul is pressing against our boundaries. Not attacking—just... existing nearby with such malevolent intensity that it's warping dimensional space."[/b]

*line_break

[b]"We've been reinforcing the barriers every night. But it's exhausting us."[/b]

*page_break

Izack responds. [b]"Perhaps it's time to teach the advanced students boundary reinforcement. Collaborative maintenance could distribute the load."[/b]

*page_break

*choice
  #Step out and volunteer—you can help with this.
    *set collaboration +15
    *goto spire_volunteer

  #Continue listening—there might be more.
    *goto spire_continue_listening

*label spire_volunteer

You step forward.

"I can help. We all can. The students—we're stronger than you think."

*page_break

Aria's eyes narrow, but Izack looks thoughtful.

*page_break

*goto spire_revelation

*label spire_continue_listening

Aria speaks again. [b]"There's another option. We could invoke the First Compact—ask the Fae for assistance."[/b]

*line_break

Izack shakes his head violently. [b]"No. Fae deals always have hidden costs. I won't endanger the students that way."[/b]

*page_break

[i]"Smart man,"[/i] Polly whispers. [i]"Fae help is worse than the problem."[/i]

*page_break

*choice
  #Reveal yourself now—this is too important to hide.
    *goto spire_direct_approach

  #Slip away with this knowledge—you know enough.
    *set secret_knowledge_gained true
    *goto investigation_complete

*label spire_revelation

Izack gestures to the Spire.

[b]"Look closely."[/b]

*page_break

You focus your senses on the dimensional barriers.

Now that you know what to look for, you can see it: hairline fractures, invisible to normal sight but clear to trained perception.

*line_break

The boundaries between Avalon and other realms are under strain.

*page_break

[b]"We've been maintaining them,"[/b] Aria explains. [b]"But we're only three mages. Even with our experience, the load is becoming unsustainable."[/b]

*line_break

Izack meets your eyes. [b]"This is why we push collaboration so hard. Avalon can't survive on individual power alone. It requires a community sharing the burden."[/b]

*page_break

*choice
  #"Teach us. Let the students help maintain the boundaries."

*label spire_student_help

Izack and Aria exchange a long look.

*page_break

[b]"You understand what you're offering?"[/b] Aria asks. [b]"This isn't optional practice. These boundaries failing means Avalon ceases to exist. The pressure is immense."[/b]

*line_break

"I understand. And I think the other students will too."

*page_break

Izack smiles sadly. [b]"You're braver than we were at your age. Very well—tomorrow, we'll begin training a student maintenance corps."[/b]

You think about everything you've learned.

*page_break

"What if... what if we made the boundaries adaptive? Taught them to flex rather than just resist?"

*line_break

Aria blinks. [b]"Explain."[/b]

*page_break

"You've taught us that boundaries want to connect realms, not just separate them. What if we redesigned Avalon's barriers to absorb pressure and transform it into something useful?"

*page_break

Izack's eyes light up. [b]"Like dimensional judo—using the demon realm's hostile pressure against itself..."[/b]

*line_break

Aria is already calculating. [b]"It would require complete boundary restructuring. Incredibly complex. But theoretically possible."[/b]

*page_break

[b]"And it would need collaborative effort,"[/b] Izack adds. [b]"Every student contributing their understanding of boundaries and adaptation."[/b]

*comment VAULT INVESTIGATION
*comment ================================================

*label vault_investigation

The lower vaults are forbidden to students for good reason.

They house the dangerous, the experimental, and the deeply weird.

*page_break

[i]"I've only been down here twice,"[/i] Polly says nervously. [i]"Both times involved things that shouldn't exist."[/i]

*page_break

You descend stone stairs that spiral downward into the earth.

The temperature drops. The air feels thick with concentrated magic.

*line_break

And you hear... singing?

*page_break

Following the sound, you find Zara in a chamber filled with crystalline formations.

She's not alone.

*page_break

Floating before her is a being of pure light and shadow—beautiful, terrifying, clearly not from any realm you recognize.

*page_break

[i]"Oh no,"[/i] Polly breathes. [i]"That's an Umbral Angel. They're from the void between realms. What's it doing here?"[/i]

*page_break

*choice

    *goto vault_observe

  #Call out to Zara—she might need help.
    *set approach_method "protective"
    *goto vault_intervene

*label vault_observe

You watch as Zara and the Umbral Angel continue their... conversation? Ritual?

*page_break

The being speaks in harmonics rather than words. Zara responds with gestures that leave trails of light.

*line_break

Gradually, you understand: they're negotiating.

*page_break

The angel wants passage through Avalon to reach another realm. Zara is explaining why that's impossible without destabilizing everything.

*page_break

Finally, they reach agreement.

The angel will wait. When Avalon's boundaries are stronger, safe passage can be arranged.

*line_break

In return, it offers knowledge of void-magic—power drawn from the spaces between realities.

*page_break

The angel fades.

Zara slumps, exhausted.

*page_break

*choice
  #Reveal yourself and help her back upstairs.
    *set zara_relationship +15

"Zara!" you call out.

*page_break

She spins, shocked. The Umbral Angel's attention shifts to you.

*line_break

You feel its regard—ancient, alien, utterly inhuman.

*page_break

[b]"${name}?"[/b] Zara's voice is strained. [b]"You shouldn't be here. This is... delicate."[/b]

*line_break

The angel speaks directly into your mind: [i]ANOTHER WITNESS. CURIOUS.[/i]

*page_break

  #Stand your ground—show no fear.
    *set courage +15
    *goto vault_confidence

  #Back away slowly—you're in over your head.
    *goto vault_retreat

*label vault_confidence

You meet the angel's non-gaze steadily.

"I'm a student of Avalon Academy. Whatever business you have here, I trust Zara to handle it wisely."

*page_break

The angel seems... amused?

[i]BRAVE. FOR ONE SO SMALL.[/i]

*line_break

It addresses Zara again. [i]YOUR STUDENTS HAVE POTENTIAL. I WILL REMEMBER THIS NEGOTIATION.[/i]

*page_break

The angel fades.

*page_break

*goto vault_help_zara

*label vault_retreat

You back away carefully.

The angel loses interest, returning its focus to Zara.

*line_break

You watch from a safer distance as they conclude their negotiation.

*page_break

*goto vault_help_zara

*label vault_help_zara

When the angel is gone, Zara nearly collapses.

You rush forward, supporting her.

*page_break

[b]"Thanks,"[/b] she murmurs. [b]"Umbral Angels are... exhausting. They exist in multiple dimensions simultaneously. Communicating with them is like thinking in four directions at once."[/b]

*page_break

You help her up the stairs.

*line_break

[b]"The masters don't know I do this,"[/b] she admits. [b]"Negotiating with beings from the void realms. But someone has to. They're curious about Avalon, and curiosity left unmanaged leads to problems."[/b]

[b]"They have enough to worry about. The boundary strain, teaching, managing the academy..."[/b]

*comment GARDEN INVESTIGATION
*comment ================================================

*label garden_investigation

The gardens at night are alive in ways they aren't during the day.

Plants that looked ordinary in sunlight now glow with bioluminescence. Flowers hum with barely-audible music.

*line_break

And at the center, something is definitely wrong.

*page_break

A massive bloom—easily twenty feet across—pulses with unstable energy.

It's beautiful and dangerous, oscillating between multiple states of reality.

*page_break

[i]"That's a Reality Rose,"[/i] Polly says. [i]"They bloom once every decade and cause absolute chaos. Every probability near them becomes simultaneously real."[/i]

*page_break

As you watch, you see the rose existing in multiple states:

• Fully bloomed and radiant
• Wilted and dying
• Still a bud, potential unrealized
• All three at once

*page_break

Around it, reality fractures.

The same bench exists in three different positions. A tree is simultaneously young, mature, and ancient.

*line_break

And it's spreading.

*page_break

*choice
  #Try to stabilize the rose using boundary techniques.
    *set approach_method "technical"
    *goto garden_stabilize

  #Let it bloom naturally—this might be beautiful, not dangerous.

    *goto garden_observe_bloom

  #Find the masters—this is beyond your ability.
    *set approach_method "cautious"
    *goto garden_get_help

*label garden_stabilize

You focus your boundary training on the Reality Rose.

*page_break

The challenge is complex—how do you stabilize something that's simultaneously in multiple states?

*line_break

Then you remember: boundaries don't enforce single realities. They mediate between them.

*page_break

Instead of forcing the rose into one state, you create gentle boundaries [i]between[/i] its different states.

*line_break

Let it be all three things—just in organized layers rather than chaotic overlap.

*page_break

Slowly, carefully, the probability storm calms.

The rose still exists in multiple states, but now they're harmonious rather than destructive.

*page_break

[i]"Brilliant!"[/i] Polly exclaims. [i]"You didn't fight its nature—you just helped it express that nature more cleanly."[/i]

*page_break

The rose seems to acknowledge you—all three versions simultaneously bowing their petals in your direction.

*page_break

*set secret_revealed "reality_rose"
*set reality_rose_stabilized true
*set aria_relationship +20
*set collaboration +15

*goto investigation_complete

*label garden_observe_bloom

You sit near the rose and simply watch.

*page_break

As the night progresses, the probability storm reaches its peak—then begins to resolve.

*line_break

The rose doesn't collapse into a single state. Instead, it achieves perfect balance between all possibilities.

*page_break

You witness something profound:

Reality isn't a single track. It's a symphony of possibilities existing in delicate balance.

*page_break

The rose fully blooms in all states simultaneously—an impossible, beautiful paradox.

*line_break

Seeds drift off on the night breeze, each carrying that same quantum uncertainty.

*page_break

[i]"You just watched something most mages never see,"[/i] Polly whispers. [i]"The Reality Rose choosing to be everything it could be rather than just one thing."[/i]

[b]"Oh, it's bloom night! I forgot this was the year."[/b]

*page_break

He sits beside the rose casually.

*line_break

[b]"Come, sit. This happens naturally. We just need to make sure it doesn't spread beyond the garden boundaries."[/b]

*page_break

You spend the night with Izack, containing the probability storm while letting the rose bloom freely.

He teaches you techniques for managing quantum uncertainty that aren't in any textbook.

Three weeks into your research, Aria announces it's time to move from theory to practice.

[b]"Reading about magic is valuable,"[/b] she explains, [b]"but research means [i]doing[/i]. Testing hypotheses. Running experiments. Sometimes failing spectacularly."[/b]

She sets up an experimental apparatus—crystalline sensors surrounding a small dimensional rift.

Two months after the conference, you're deep in your research when it happens.

The moment every researcher dreams of.

The moment when everything [i]clicks[/i].

You're reviewing your experimental data—readings you've analyzed dozens of times—when suddenly you see it. The pattern you've been missing.

  Dimensional stability isn't about harmonic resonance at all. It's about [i]memory[/i].

*if magical_aptitude = "ritualist"
  The runes etched around the chamber remind you of the rituals you relied on back home—patterns and preparation steady your breathing.
*if magical_aptitude = "intuitive"
  Dimensional music hums at the edge of your senses, eager to be improvised with.
*if magical_aptitude = "wild_talent"
  Raw power thrums at your fingertips; the challenge will be guiding it instead of wrestling it.

The lesson chamber is breathtaking. Crystalline walls pulse with leyline energy, and dimensional boundaries shimmer visibly in the air like heat waves made of starlight.

*line_break

Izack stands at the center, surrounded by five other students. You recognize a few faces from the portal crossing—all nervous, all excited.

"Welcome," Izack begins, his voice carrying to every corner without needing to be loud. "Today we're learning to [i]feel[/i] dimensional boundaries. Not to break them, but to understand their nature."

*page_break

He gestures, and the air ripples. Reality itself seems to bend, revealing the membrane between dimensions—a shimmering, almost musical barrier.

"Reach out—not with your hands, but with your awareness. What does the boundary feel like?"

*line_break

You close your eyes and extend your senses. The boundary feels like... a membrane. Flexible. Almost musical. It has texture, temperature, even something like emotion.

*line_break

[i]"Good. Now here's the fun part—Izack wants you to work together to create a harmonic resonance. Multiple mages, one unified frequency."[/i]

*page_break

Izack nods. "Exactly. Zara, would you demonstrate with ${name}?"

*if zara_relationship > 50
  Zara practically beams as she takes your hand.
  *set lesson_success +1
*else
  Zara takes your hand with a professional nod.

"Just match my breathing," she says softly. "Let our intentions align."

*if social_style = "diplomatic"
  Your instinct is to make space for Zara's rhythm first, smoothing any awkwardness.
*if social_style = "observant"
  You watch the subtleties of her inhale and exhale, letting data guide your empathy.
*if social_style = "provocateur"
  Part of you wants to push the tempo just to see how she reacts—but this is collaboration, not chaos.

      Your instinct to harmonize makes the link smoother than expected.
      *set zara_relationship +2

    You let go of control and simply follow Zara's lead. Your breathing synchronizes, your heartbeat aligns, and suddenly—

    The boundary becomes [i]clear[/i]. You're seeing it through both your perspective and Zara's, and it's infinitely more detailed than before.

    "Beautiful," Izack murmurs. "This is partnership magic."

      You've been studying everyone's rhythm since class began; weaving them together comes easily.
      *set collaboration +3

    An instinct tells you there's more. You reach out with your awareness, inviting the other students into the resonance.

    One by one, they join. Five minds, five hearts, one unified frequency.

    *if background_origin = "frontier_mender"
      You've learned when to retreat before a leyline snaps; caution keeps the damage minimal.
      *set lesson_success +1

    The sensation of your consciousness blending with Zara's is too intense, too fast. You instinctively pull back.

    And in that moment, the resonance destabilizes.

The dimensional boundary doesn't just become visible—it [i]sings[/i]. You can feel its nature, its preferences, the way it wants to flex and flow. Together, your group creates a perfect harmonic resonance.

Izack's eyes shine with unshed tears. "This is exactly what Avalon was built for. You just demonstrated the Third Thread—collaborative magic that transcends individual limitations."

*line_break

Aria appears at the doorway, clearly moved despite her usual composure. "In my years of dimensional work, I've never seen students achieve this level of connection on their first day."

Zara squeezes your hand, grinning. "We did it!"

The lesson continues for another hour, but the breakthrough moment has set the tone. You've proven yourself capable of true collaboration.

You and Zara maintain the connection, refining it. The boundary becomes crystal clear between your merged awareness.

Izack nods approvingly. "Beautiful work. This is partnership magic—two becoming greater than the sum of their parts."

Zara gasps. "The harmonics are collapsing!"

The collaborative resonance destabilizes, and the dimensional boundary you were examining begins to crack. A hairline fracture spreads across the shimmering membrane.

Aria's voice cuts through the rising panic. "Everyone, step back. Izack—"

Izack is already moving, reaching for the fracturing boundary, but you can see the strain on his face. The crack is spreading faster than he can repair it alone.

*line_break

[i]"Right. So this is a teachable moment about why we don't panic-quit collaborative spells. Your move, student."[/i]

    You push past your fear and reach out again—not just to Zara, but to everyone. "Together! Like before!"

    Zara grabs your hand immediately. The other students join. Izack's eyes widen as he feels the collaborative resonance snap into place.

    "That's it," he breathes. "Channel it through me—I'll direct the repair."

    Six students and one master mage, working as one. The fractured boundary responds to your unified intention, the cracks sealing like wounds knitting together.

    *goto crisis_resolved

  #Stay back—you don't want to make it worse.

    You step back, watching as Izack and Aria work together to seal the fracture. Their magic interweaves perfectly—his intuitive feel for dimensional currents, her precise boundary control.

    The crack seals. Crisis averted.

    But Izack turns to you with disappointment in his eyes.

    "You had the ability to help. Instead, you chose to be a bystander."

The boundary stabilizes, then settles into a perfect, shimmering membrane. The danger passes.

Aria exhales. "Impressive crisis management. You recognized that individual strength wasn't enough and chose collaboration instead."

Izack smiles, clearly proud. "This is exactly why Avalon exists."

The lesson continues, but you can feel the weight of judgment.

Several days later, Izack gathers the class with exciting news.

"Avalon has grown far beyond what I originally imagined," he says, eyes bright with wonder. "This realm now spans multiple biomes—forests that think, oceans that remember the past, deserts lit by eternal flame. We've arranged field expeditions for advanced students to explore these regions."

*line_break

[i]"Translation: he accidentally created a small planet and now needs students to go poke around and make sure nothing's trying to eat the academy. It's educational AND practical!"[/i]

*line_break

Aria steps forward with a crystalline map that shifts and glows.

"We have three expeditions departing tomorrow. Each will teach different aspects of magic through direct environmental interaction."

*page_break

She points to three glowing regions on the map:

[b]The Singing Dunes[/b] - A desert where the sand responds to truth and lies. You'll learn about honesty in magic and oath-binding.

[b]The Verdant Tithe[/b] - An ancient forest where every thought has weight. Perfect for studying the connection between mind and nature.

[b]The Rune Glacier[/b] - A constantly shifting ice field inscribed with living spells. Ideal for those who want to understand written magic at its most dynamic.

*line_break

*if academic_focus = "research"
  Your research habits itch to test themselves against the Rune Glacier's living runes.
*if academic_focus = "applied_craft"
  The Verdant Tithe's alchemy and the Glacier's inscriptions both promise hands-on puzzles.
*if academic_focus = "fieldwork"
  The Singing Dunes and the Tithe both match your preference for learning from living realms.

  Windborne instincts tell you that open expanses like the Dunes will feel familiar.

  Archivist training whispers that the Glacier's recorded memory could be priceless.

  Field repairs on the frontier make you confident about surviving the Tithe's living labyrinth.

*if magical_aptitude = "wild_talent"
  Polly pecks your shoulder. "Maybe pick somewhere that will teach you finesse, not just raw force," she mutters.

[i]"Choose wisely. Each one will try to kill you in completely different ways. I'll be supervising the Dunes trip because watching students panic when the sand starts screaming never gets old."[/i]

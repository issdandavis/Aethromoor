[b]== HIDDEN LORE DISCOVERED ==[/b]

*line_break

Late one night, unable to sleep, you wander Avalon's corridors in search of... something. You're not sure what. Maybe just peace. Maybe answers to questions you haven't learned to ask yet.

The Academy responds to your restlessness. A corridor you've walked a hundred times suddenly branches differently, revealing a staircase that spirals down into darkness lit only by faint bioluminescent moss. You know, with the certainty that comes from dimensional intuition, that this path has been waiting for you specifically—that Avalon itself has decided you're ready to see what lies below.

*page_break

You descend.

The air grows warmer, then cooler, then shifts through temperatures that don't quite make physical sense. You're moving through dimensional layers, passing through boundaries between what Avalon shows to everyone and what it reveals only to those it trusts.

At the bottom, you find a hidden chamber—Polly's personal archives, a sanctuary she's maintained for three centuries. The walls are lined with crystalline memory-storage devices that glow softly, each one containing a lifetime's worth of observations. This is where she keeps the truths too dangerous or too precious to share casually.

*page_break

One scroll sits alone on a pedestal at the chamber's center, as if waiting. Its title gleams in script that shifts between every language you know: [i]"The Third Thread: A Mystery Unresolved"[/i]

*line_break

Your hands tremble slightly as you unroll it. This feels important—the kind of important that changes destinies.

*page_break

You read Polly's meticulous handwriting, noting how it evolves across the scroll—starting confident, becoming uncertain, ending almost desperate:

[i]"Three beings in this age carry the Third Thread—a magical lineage so ancient that even I, with three centuries of accumulated knowledge, don't fully understand its nature or origin:"[/i]

*line_break

[i]"1. Zara - Hybrid of Skybrood dragon-lineage, Auridani star-touched heritage, and the Third Thread that binds them into something entirely new. Her magic doesn't command—it [b]listens[/b]. She perceives connections others miss, hears harmonies in chaos. Izack's first student, and perhaps his greatest success. She embodies what collaborative magic can become when taken to its ultimate expression."[/i]

[i]"2. Alexander Thorne - Son of Izack and Aria, born during a dimensionally braided eclipse when three realms aligned. His birth rewrote local reality, created new leyline patterns, caused flowers to bloom in the dead of winter. He carries his father's intuitive dimensional sense and his mother's precise boundary control, but there's something else—something that makes even ancient beings pause when they sense him."[/i]

[i]"3. The Unnamed One - An entity from Varn'ka'zul's borders, neither fully demon nor fully something else. Purpose unknown. Nature uncertain. They appeared during the last great dimensional convergence, spoke words that made reality crack, then vanished. I've spent decades trying to understand what they want. I still don't know. That terrifies me more than I care to admit."[/i]

*page_break

[i]"What connects them? Is it bloodline—some genetic marker that transcends species? Is it prophecy—some cosmic script being written across dimensions? Or is it something stranger, something that doesn't fit into the categories we use to make sense of magic?"[/i]

[i]"The Third Thread represents magic that exists outside the traditional frameworks. Not runic, not ritual, not elemental, not divine, not demonic—but something else. Something [b]collaborative[/b] at a level that makes normal partnership magic look like children playing at cooperation."[/i]

*line_break

[i]"Whoever reads this: if you discover the truth, find me and tell me. I've been searching for three centuries. I've watched civilizations rise and fall. I've witnessed dimensional collapses and reality-rebirths. And I still don't understand what the Third Thread truly is."[/i]

[i]"I'm beginning to suspect it might be the answer to everything. Or the question we've been too afraid to ask."[/i]

[i]"— Polly, Polydimensional Manifestation of Accumulated Wisdom and Increasing Desperation"[/i]

*page_break

*if familiar_type = "polly"
  Polly materializes beside you like thought becoming solid, her appearance sudden enough to make you jump. For once, she's not perched somewhere being sarcastic—she's standing on the pedestal beside her own scroll, and her expression is complicated: surprised, pleased, worried, hopeful, all at once.

  [i]"You found that,"[/i] she says quietly, voice stripped of its usual armor of humor. [i]"Clever ${boy_girl}. Most students never find this chamber. Avalon doesn't show it to just anyone—it has to trust you completely first."[/i]

  *line_break

  She hops closer, fixing you with eyes that have witnessed centuries.

  [i]"Yes, the Third Thread is real. And you, ${name}... you might be connected to it too. I've been watching you. The way magic responds when you touch it. The way the Spiral recognizes you. The way dimensional boundaries seem to thin around you when you're not even trying."[/i]

  *line_break

  [i]"I don't know what it means yet. But I intend to find out. And I think... I think you're going to help me understand what I've been missing for three hundred years."[/i]

  You stand alone in the hidden chamber, holding a scroll that might contain answers to questions you didn't know existed. The weight of what you've learned settles over you like a cloak—not uncomfortable, but undeniable.

  You feel like you've uncovered something important. Something that might change everything.

  The Third Thread. Zara. Alexander. The Unnamed One.

  And maybe... maybe you.

  [b]== WARNING: DIMENSIONAL ANOMALY DETECTED ==[/b]

  *line_break

  During an experiment, your magic tears through reality itself.

  For one horrifying moment, you see [i]through[/i] Avalon into the realm beyond.

  *page_break

  Varn'ka'zul.

  The Demon Realm.

  *line_break

  Rivers flowing upward. Shadows that glow. A citadel of basalt where screams are currency.

  *page_break

  A voice whispers from the void:

  [i][b]"Ambitious one. You have potential. We could teach you power beyond imagination..."[/b][/i]

      You slam the dimensional breach shut with all your will.

      The whispers fade.

      *page_break

      You're shaking. You saw something you weren't meant to see.

      But you chose safety over power.

      The voice continues:

      *page_break

      Suddenly, Izack appears and [i]forces[/i] the tear shut.

      His expression is terrified.

      [b]"${name}! Do you have any idea what you almost did?!"[/b]

      *page_break

      You've discovered something dangerous.

      And it discovered you.

  *if familiar_type != "void"
    Through careful exploration, you find a doorway that shimmers with impossible colors.

  *page_break

  You step through.

  *line_break

  The Dimensional Fringe.

  The space [i]between[/i] spaces.

  *page_break

  Here, gravity is optional. Time flows in multiple directions. You see ghost images of other timelines, other choices you [i]could[/i] have made.

  *line_break

  In one timeline, you failed your expedition.

  In another, you became legendary.

  In a third, you fell in love differently.

  *page_break

  At the center of the Fringe, you find an ancient waystone with an inscription:

  *line_break

  [i]"Where boundary folds and memory listens, let this incantation become invitation."[/i]

  *line_break

  [i]— Izack Thorne, Age 130, Before the Academy[/i]

  *page_break

  You've found where Izack first discovered dimensional magic.

  The very place where Avalon Academy's philosophy was born.

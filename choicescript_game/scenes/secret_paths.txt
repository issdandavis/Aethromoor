[b]== HIDDEN LORE DISCOVERED ==[/b]

*line_break

Late one night, you discover a hidden chamber beneath the Academy.

Inside, you find ancient records—Polly's personal archives spanning centuries.

*page_break

One scroll catches your eye: [i]"The Third Thread: A Mystery Unresolved"[/i]

*line_break

You read:

*page_break

[i]"Three beings in this age carry the Third Thread—a magical lineage so ancient even I don't fully understand it:"[/i]

*line_break

[i]"1. Zara - Skybrood, Auridani, Third Thread. Her magic 'listens' rather than 'commands.'"[/i]

[i]"2. Alexander - Izack and Aria's son, born during dimensionally braided eclipse."[/i]

[i]"3. The Demon Child - entity from Varn'ka'zul, purpose unknown."[/i]

*page_break

[i]"What connects them? What does the Third Thread represent?"[/i]

[i]"Is it prophecy? Bloodline? Or something stranger?"[/i]

*line_break

[i]"Whoever reads this: if you discover the truth, tell me. I've been searching for three centuries."[/i]

[i]"— Polly"[/i]

*page_break

*if familiar_type = "polly"
  Polly materializes beside you, looking surprised.

  [i]"You found that. Clever ${boy_girl}. Yes, the Third Thread is real. And you, ${name}... you might be connected to it too."[/i]

  *set hidden_lore_discovered +1
  *set secret_paths_found +1

*if familiar_type != "polly"
  You feel like you've uncovered something important.

  Something that might change everything.

  [b]== WARNING: DIMENSIONAL ANOMALY DETECTED ==[/b]

  *line_break

  During an experiment, your magic tears through reality itself.

  For one horrifying moment, you see [i]through[/i] Avalon into the realm beyond.

  *page_break

  Varn'ka'zul.

  The Demon Realm.

  *line_break

  Rivers flowing upward. Shadows that glow. A citadel of basalt where screams are currency.

  *page_break

  A voice whispers from the void:

  [i][b]"Ambitious one. You have potential. We could teach you power beyond imagination..."[/b][/i]

  *page_break

  *choice
    #Close the tear immediately. This is dangerous.
      *set collaboration +15
      *set honesty_vs_deception +10

      You slam the dimensional breach shut with all your will.

      The whispers fade.

      *page_break

      You're shaking. You saw something you weren't meant to see.

      But you chose safety over power.

      *set secret_paths_found +1
      *goto_scene final_trial

    #Listen for just a moment longer...
      *set power +20
      *set collaboration -15
      *set warnings_ignored +1
      *set failures +1

      You hesitate.

      The voice continues:

      [i][b]"Yessss. Curiosity. Ambition. We can work with that..."[/b][/i]

      *page_break

      Suddenly, Izack appears and [i]forces[/i] the tear shut.

      His expression is terrified.

      [b]"${name}! Do you have any idea what you almost did?!"[/b]

      *page_break

      You've discovered something dangerous.

      And it discovered you.

  [b]== HIDDEN AREA DISCOVERED: THE DIMENSIONAL FRINGE ==[/b]

  *line_break

  *if familiar_type = "void"
    ${familiar_name} leads you to a part of Avalon that [i]shouldn't exist[/i].

  *if familiar_type != "void"
    Through careful exploration, you find a doorway that shimmers with impossible colors.

  *page_break

  You step through.

  *line_break

  The Dimensional Fringe.

  The space [i]between[/i] spaces.

  *page_break

  Here, gravity is optional. Time flows in multiple directions. You see ghost images of other timelines, other choices you [i]could[/i] have made.

  *line_break

  In one timeline, you failed your expedition.

  In another, you became legendary.

  In a third, you fell in love differently.

  *page_break

  At the center of the Fringe, you find an ancient waystone with an inscription:

  *line_break

  [i]"Where boundary folds and memory listens, let this incantation become invitation."[/i]

  *line_break

  [i]— Izack Thorne, Age 130, Before the Academy[/i]

  *page_break

  You've found where Izack first discovered dimensional magic.

  The very place where Avalon Academy's philosophy was born.

You've uncovered lore that most mages never find.

Polly appears before you, whether she's your familiar or not.

[i]"Impressive, ${name}. You found secrets even some of the faculty don't know."[/i]

*line_break

[i]"You're not just learning magic. You're uncovering Avalon's hidden heart."[/i]

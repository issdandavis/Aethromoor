You've completed your first year at Avalon Academy.

One year ago, you walked through those crystalline gates as a nervous newcomer, portal-sick and uncertain. Today, you stand in the Grand Hall as a true student of dimensional magic.

  Your raw magical power has impressed even the most demanding instructors.

  Your theoretical understanding has made you one of Aria's most promising students.
*if empathy > 70
  Your ability to understand others has made you invaluable in group work.

But Year One was preparation. The foundation.

Now comes the true education.

[i]"And now comes the part where they make you choose your future,"[/i] Polly mutters from her perch above the hall. [i]"No pressure. Just the next three years of your life and most of your available endings. Caw."[/i]

The three master mages stand at the front of the Grand Hall. Izack Thorne, Aria Ravencrest, and Zara—your teachers, your mentors, and now your potential guides for the next three years.

*line_break

Izack steps forward, his warm smile tempered by unusual seriousness.

*page_break

"First-year students learn together," he begins. "You share lessons, experiences, the foundation of dimensional magic. But starting in Year Two, Avalon asks you to choose a path."

*line_break

Aria continues, her voice sharp and precise. "Not a specialization—you'll continue studying all schools of magic. Rather, this is a choice of [i]focus[/i]. A commitment to how you'll spend the next three years. The problems you'll solve. The person you'll become."

*page_break

Zara speaks last, her tone gentle but firm. "This choice is binding. You cannot change paths once committed. Choose carefully."

*line_break

A shimmer of magical energy fills the hall. Three doors materialize along the back wall, each one glowing with distinct resonance.

*page_break

*label research_door_explanation

[b]THE RESEARCH PATH[/b]

*line_break

Aria gestures to the first door—it glows with cool blue light, inscribed with equations and theoretical diagrams that shift and evolve.

*page_break

"The Research Path," Aria explains, "is for those who seek to understand the [i]why[/i] behind dimensional magic. You'll work directly with me on advanced theoretical projects. Publishing papers. Conducting experiments. Pushing the boundaries of what we know about reality itself."

*line_break

She pauses, her gaze sweeping the assembled students.

*page_break

"You'll spend Years Two through Four in intensive study. The Archives will become your second home. You'll collaborate with dimensional scholars from across the realms. Your thesis project in Year Four could revolutionize magical theory."

*line_break

"But," she adds, her voice cooling, "you'll miss practical combat training. You won't delve into dangerous dimensions hunting artifacts. And you'll have minimal involvement in inter-dimensional politics."

*page_break

*if aria_recommends
  Aria's eyes find yours. "${name}, your theoretical aptitude makes you particularly suited for this path. I would be honored to mentor you."

  *set aria_relationship +5

*line_break

[i]"The research path,"[/i] Polly whispers, [i]"means becoming a true scholar. Late nights in the Archives. Breakthrough discoveries. Academic fame. But also isolation, endless theories, and the real possibility of going slightly mad from dimensional mathematics."[/i]

*page_break

*label combat_door_explanation

[b]THE COMBAT PATH[/b]

*line_break

Zara steps toward the second door—it pulses with fierce crimson light, carved with battle-wards and protective runes that seem to move defensively.

*page_break

"The Combat Path," Zara says, her voice carrying the weight of experience, "is for those who will defend the realms. Battle mages. Dungeon delvers. The ones who stand between dimensional threats and innocent lives."

*line_break

She places her hand on the glowing door, and the runes flare brighter.

*page_break

"You'll train intensively in magical combat. Learn to fight alone and in tactical teams. You'll venture into dangerous dimensions—not as researchers, but as warriors. By Year Four, you'll be capable of solo dungeon runs that would terrify most graduate students."

*line_break

"However," she warns, "you'll sacrifice advanced theoretical study. No publishing papers or revolutionary discoveries. And you'll be too busy training to engage with diplomatic missions."

*page_break

*if zara_recommends
  Zara meets your eyes, nodding with respect. "${name}, your magical power and combat instincts are exceptional. I can make you into one of the greatest battle mages Avalon has ever produced."

  *set zara_relationship +5

*line_break

[i]"The combat path,"[/i] Polly notes dryly, [i]"means becoming Avalon's defender. Exciting adventures, legendary duels, and protecting people who can't protect themselves. But also constant danger, combat-related trauma, and a distressing number of scars."[/i]

*page_break

*label diplomatic_door_explanation

[b]THE DIPLOMATIC PATH[/b]

*line_break

Izack approaches the third door—it shimmers with golden light, inscribed with symbols from dozens of dimensional languages, all harmonizing together.

*page_break

"The Diplomatic Path," Izack explains warmly, "is for those who will bridge worlds. Negotiators. Ambassadors. The ones who prevent conflicts before they require battle mages."

*line_break

He gestures, and the symbols on the door rearrange themselves into new patterns.

*page_break

"You'll work with dimensional diplomats from across the multiverse. Learn dozens of cultural traditions, magical customs, political structures. You'll negotiate treaties, resolve disputes, build alliances. By Year Four, you'll be representing Avalon in inter-dimensional summits."

*line_break

"The trade-off," he says gently, "is that you'll miss deep theoretical research and intensive combat training. You'll be too busy negotiating to publish papers or delve dungeons."

*page_break

*if izack_recommends
  Izack's expression softens as he looks at you. "${name}, your empathy and understanding of collaborative magic make you a natural diplomat. I believe you could change the future of inter-dimensional relations."

  *set izack_relationship +5

*line_break

[i]"The diplomatic path,"[/i] Polly muses, [i]"means becoming a bridge between worlds. Preventing wars, building peace, making genuine change. But also endless politics, cultural missteps that could cause incidents, and the soul-crushing weight of responsibility for entire dimensions."[/i]

*page_break

*label reflection_moment

The three doors glow before you.

Research. Combat. Diplomacy.

*line_break

Each path leads to different content, different mentors, different endings. Once you choose, there is no going back.

*page_break

[i]"This is it,"[/i] Polly says quietly, her sarcasm fading. [i]"The choice that defines who you become. Choose the path that calls to your heart, ${name}. Not what others recommend. Not what seems safest. What feels [i]true[/i]."[/i]

*line_break

She meets your eyes seriously. "I won't sugarcoat this. The Combat Path is dangerous. You'll face real threats. Some students get injured. But you'll also become capable of protecting entire dimensions."

[b]Year Three:[/b] Leading minor negotiations, mediating student disputes, cultural exchange programs, building relationships with dimensional representatives.

*line_break

[b]Year Four:[/b] Independent diplomatic missions, representing Avalon at inter-dimensional summits, potentially negotiating treaties that affect millions of lives."

*page_break

He continues gently, "You'll work with representatives from dimensions you've never imagined. Some negotiations will be frustrating. Some will fail. But when you succeed in preventing a conflict that would have cost lives—there's no better feeling."

*line_break

"Diplomatic Path graduates become Ambassadors, Cultural Liaisons, Treaty Negotiators, and Inter-Dimensional Mediators. They're the ones who build the bridges that make places like Avalon possible."

He gestures to the three doors.

The portal closes behind you with a crystalline chime, and the temperature plummets forty degrees in an instant.

*line_break

You stand on the Rune Glacier—an impossible expanse of living ice that stretches to the horizon. Runes shimmer beneath the surface, moving like fish in deep water, rewriting themselves in patterns that predate language itself.

*page_break

Polly materializes on your shoulder, fluffing her feathers against the cold.

[i]"Brrr. Right. The Rune Glacier. Where magic is so ancient it forgot how to die properly."[/i]

*line_break

She hops to a nearby ice formation. Beneath the surface, a rune pulses with soft blue light.

[i]"These runes are alive, ${name}. Actually alive. They remember the First Tongue—the language used to create dimensional magic itself. Some mages try to control them. Others try to harmonize with them. A rare few... well, that's more interesting."[/i]

*page_break

A figure approaches across the ice—not walking on it, but [i]through[/i] it, as if the glacier itself is carrying them.

When they emerge, you see a crystalline being that might have once been human but has become something else entirely. Their skin shimmers with frost patterns, and living runes swim beneath their translucent surface.

*line_break

[b]"New student,"[/b] they say, their voice like ice cracking. [b]"I am what remains of Theron, or what Theron became. I am the glacier's memory of a mage who sought to understand."[/b]

*page_break

Theron gestures to the ice beneath your feet. Hundreds of runes swirl in the depths.

[b]"The glacier tests all who come here. It offers three paths, and each reveals a different truth about power."[/b]

*line_break

Three sections of ice begin to glow:

[b]Blue ice[/b] to the left—rigid, geometric patterns. The path of Control.

[b]Silver ice[/b] to the right—flowing, organic shapes. The path of Harmony.

[b]Translucent ice[/b] ahead—constantly shifting, unknowable. The path of Mystery.

*comment ================================================

*label path_control

You step onto the blue ice.

Immediately, the runes beneath your feet stop moving. They lock into rigid, geometric patterns—perfect arrays of power waiting to be commanded.

*line_break

Theron watches from a distance, their expression unreadable.

[b]"The path of Control. You believe power comes from mastery, from bending magic to your will. Let us see if you are strong enough."[/b]

*page_break

The ice beneath you begins to shift, rising into a platform. Runes spiral upward, forming a column of frozen light.

You reach out with your dimensional sense, and you can [i]feel[/i] them—thousands of runes, each a word of power in the First Tongue. Each one waiting to be commanded.

*page_break

    You channel your will into the ice, [i]demanding[/i] obedience.

    The runes resist.

    *line_break

    They push back against your power like a living thing, testing your strength. For a moment, you feel them slipping away—

    —and then you [i]push harder[/i].

    *page_break

    The runes snap into alignment.

    Every single one locks into the pattern you commanded. The ice responds to your will, reshaping itself into crystalline spires that gleam with captured power.

    *line_break

    Theron's expression shifts to something like respect.

    [b]"Strong enough,"[/b] they murmur. [b]"You forced them to submit. But remember—power that requires constant force will break the moment you falter."[/b]

    You resist the urge to command immediately.

    Instead, you watch. You study the way the runes move, the patterns they naturally form, the rhythm of their ancient language.

    *line_break

    And then you see it—the structure beneath the chaos. The grammar of power itself.

    *page_break

    When you finally reach out to command them, you don't fight their nature. You work [i]with[/i] their existing patterns, giving orders that align with what they already want to do.

    The runes respond instantly.

    *line_break

    They snap into perfect formation—not because you forced them, but because you spoke their language correctly.

    *page_break

    Theron nods slowly.

    [b]"Disciplined. Precise. You understand that control is not about force—it is about perfect understanding. The glacier approves."[/b]

    You reach out to the runes—not with commands, but with an offer.

    [i]Work with me. Show me what you can do, and I'll show you what I need.[/i]

    *line_break

    For a long moment, nothing happens.

    Then the runes [i]shift[/i].

    *page_break

    They don't lock into rigid patterns. Instead, they flow around your magical presence, curious, testing. You feel their ancient intelligence brush against yours—wordless, alien, but not hostile.

    *line_break

    And then they [i]answer[/i].

    The ice reshapes itself into forms you didn't know were possible. The runes work with you, offering power you never asked for because they understood what you [i]needed[/i] instead of what you commanded.

    *page_break

    Theron's eyes widen.

    [b]"Impossible. You walked the path of Control, but you... you didn't control them at all. You [i]partnered[/i] with them."[/b]

  The glacier responds to your success.

  The blue ice beneath your feet cracks open, revealing a chamber within. Inside, thousands of runes swirl in perfect mathematical arrays.

  *line_break

  Theron gestures to the chamber.

  [b]"You have earned the glacier's gift. Enter, and receive what you have mastered."[/b]

  *page_break

  You step into the chamber.

  The runes surround you, pressing against your skin like cold fingers. You feel them [i]learning[/i] you, understanding the shape of your magic.

  *line_break

  And then they begin to [i]write[/i] themselves onto you.

  *page_break

  Living runes etch themselves across your arms, your chest, your face. They don't hurt—they feel like ice crystals forming on glass, natural and inevitable.

  When the process completes, you look down at your hands.

  *line_break

  Dozens of runes shimmer beneath your skin, waiting to be activated.

  *set artifact_earned "Runeweaver's Mark"

  *goto glacier_conclusion

  The glacier responds to your show of force.

  The ice cracks beneath your feet—not breaking, but [i]testing[/i]. The runes pulse with cold light, and you feel their resentment like a physical weight.

  *line_break

  Theron shakes their head slowly.

  [b]"You forced them to obey. They submitted because you were strong enough. But they did not [i]choose[/i] you, ${name}. And power that serves only through force will abandon you the moment you show weakness."[/b]

  *page_break

  The runes beneath your skin fade.

  You feel their power slip away, returning to the glacier.

  Something extraordinary happens.

  The blue ice beneath your feet begins to [i]melt[/i]—not into water, but into pure magical essence. The runes rise from the depths, surrounding you in a spiral of living language.

  *page_break

  Theron steps back, their expression shifting from surprise to something like awe.

  [b]"No. This... this has not happened in three hundred years."[/b]

  *line_break

  The glacier itself speaks.

  Not in words, but in runes that write themselves directly into your mind:

  [i][b]PARTNER. EQUAL. RECOGNIZED.[/b][/i]

  *page_break

  The ice around you doesn't just give you runes—it [i]merges[/i] with you.

  You feel the glacier's vast, ancient consciousness brush against yours. Not controlling. Not submitting. [i]Partnering[/i].

  *line_break

  When the transformation completes, you are still yourself—but you are also [i]more[/i].

  The Rune Glacier has accepted you as an equal. Its power flows through you not as a tool, but as a collaboration between two forms of consciousness.

  *page_break

  Living runes dance across your skin in patterns of frost and starlight. When you move, ice forms in your wake—not because you command it, but because the glacier [i]wants[/i] to move with you.

*label path_harmony

You step onto the silver ice.

Immediately, the runes beneath your feet begin to flow. They move in organic spirals, dancing to rhythms you can almost hear—like music written in light and cold.

*line_break

Theron watches, their translucent form shimmering with approval.

[b]"The path of Harmony. You believe power comes from understanding, from moving with magic rather than against it. Let us see if you can listen well enough."[/b]

*page_break

The ice beneath you begins to pulse.

You feel it—a rhythm in the glacier itself, like a heartbeat. The runes move in time with it, creating patterns that shift and flow but never repeat exactly.

*line_break

You reach out with your dimensional sense and feel the glacier's [i]song[/i].

It's not quite music. It's the resonance of ancient magic, the harmonic frequency of runes that have been alive for millennia.

    You stop trying to understand.

    Instead, you simply [i]listen[/i].

    *line_break

    You let the glacier's rhythm flow through you. You move when it moves, pause when it pauses, breathe in time with the pulse of ancient ice.

    *page_break

    And suddenly, you're not standing on the glacier anymore.

    You're [i]part of it[/i].

    *line_break

    The runes flow through your consciousness like schools of fish through water. You understand them not with your mind but with your entire being—feeling their patterns, sensing their intentions, moving with their flow.

    *page_break

    Theron's voice seems distant, reverent:

    [b]"Perfect harmony. You didn't try to control or command—you simply [i]became[/i] part of the glacier's song. This is the truest form of collaborative magic."[/b]

    You watch the runes carefully, tracking their movements.

    There's a pattern here—you're sure of it. If you can just map it, understand it, you can move in perfect sync.

    *line_break

    You spend several minutes observing, taking mental notes of every spiral, every pulse, every shift in the ice.

    *page_break

    And then you think you see it.

    You step forward, timing your movement to match what you [i]think[/i] will come next—

    —and you're half right.

    *line_break

    The glacier's rhythm shifts slightly. You predicted the general pattern, but missed the subtle variations. You're close to harmony, but not quite there.

    *page_break

    Theron nods thoughtfully.

    [b]"You tried to understand with your mind rather than your heart. Clever, but incomplete. The glacier's song cannot be fully mapped—only felt."[/b]

    You listen to the glacier's rhythm, feeling its pulse—

    —and then you add your own.

    *line_break

    Not fighting it. Not replacing it. [i]Harmonizing[/i] with it.

    You hum softly, matching the glacier's frequency, and then you add a counterpoint. A complementary rhythm that weaves around the glacier's song without disrupting it.

    *page_break

    For a moment, nothing happens.

    Then the glacier [i]responds[/i].

    *line_break

    The runes change their pattern.

    They don't just flow anymore—they [i]dance[/i]. The glacier incorporates your rhythm into its song, creating something new. Something that has never existed before.

    *page_break

    The ice beneath your feet begins to glow with warm silver light.

    Theron's eyes widen, their whole body shimmering with reflected radiance.

  *line_break

  Theron gestures toward it.

  [b]"The glacier grants you its gift. Walk the path of harmony to its end."[/b]

  *page_break

  You step into the passage.

  The walls pulse with silver light. Runes flow around you like water, brushing against your skin with cold, gentle touches.

  *line_break

  At the end of the passage, you find a pool of liquid ice—impossible, shimmering, alive.

  *page_break

  You kneel beside it and reach in.

  The liquid ice flows up your arm, wrapping around your wrist like a bracelet. It solidifies into a band of living silver, covered in flowing runes that shift and change with every heartbeat.

  The glacier acknowledges your effort.

  A small section of ice cracks open, revealing a crystalline shard within.

  *line_break

  Theron retrieves it and places it in your hand.

  [b]"You tried to understand with intellect alone. The glacier respects this, but true harmony requires more than analysis. Still, you have earned a gift."[/b]

  The shard pulses with cold light.

  When you hold it, you can feel the echo of the glacier's rhythm—faint, distant, but present.

  Something miraculous happens.

  The silver ice beneath your feet begins to [i]sing[/i].

  Not metaphorically. The glacier produces actual sound—a harmonic chord that resonates through your entire body.

  *page_break

  Theron steps back, their form shimmering with reflected light.

  [b]"This... ${name}, the glacier is [i]answering[/i] you. It hasn't sung for a living mage in over five hundred years."[/b]

  *line_break

  The runes rise from the ice in spiraling columns.

  They surround you, moving in time with the glacier's song—your song now, too.

  *page_break

  The ice doesn't just give you a gift. It [i]invites[/i] you to join it.

  You feel the glacier's vast consciousness reaching out, not to control or guide, but to [i]harmonize[/i] with your own awareness.

  *line_break

  When you accept the invitation, everything changes.

  *page_break

  You become part of the glacier's song.

  Not consumed by it—you remain yourself. But you're also connected to every rune, every particle of ice, every frozen moment trapped in the glacier's memory.

  *line_break

  When the transformation completes, you can still hear it. The glacier's song hums in the back of your mind, a constant harmonic presence.

  And when you move, the runes move with you—not commanded, but [i]dancing[/i] in rhythm with your intentions.

Then the ice beneath your feet [i]disappears[/i].

*line_break

You're falling—

—no, not falling. Sinking. The glacier is [i]pulling[/i] you down into its depths.

*page_break

Polly squawks in alarm, but her voice grows distant as you descend through layers of impossible ice.

You pass through frozen moments—glimpses of the past trapped in crystalline suspension. A mage from centuries ago, casting a spell. A battle frozen mid-strike. A kiss preserved in eternal ice.

*line_break

And then you're somewhere else entirely.

*page_break

You stand in a chamber that shouldn't exist.

The walls are made of ice so old it's turned black. Runes swim through it like galaxies, ancient and unknowable.

*line_break

In the center of the chamber sits a figure.

Not Theron. Something older.

*page_break

The figure is made entirely of runes—thousands of them, woven together into a vaguely humanoid shape that shifts and changes with every breath.

When it speaks, the voice comes from everywhere and nowhere:

[b]"Why did you choose Mystery?"[/b]

[b]"These runes are the First Tongue—the language that created dimensional magic. You wish to understand them?"[/b]

*line_break

You nod.

[b]"Then read."[/b]

*page_break

You approach the black ice walls.

The runes swim beneath the surface, impossibly complex. You try to focus on one, to understand its meaning—

—and your mind [i]breaks[/i].

*line_break

Not literally. But you feel something in your consciousness stretch and crack under the weight of what you're trying to comprehend.

This isn't language. Not really. It's something deeper. More fundamental.

    The pain intensifies. You feel your thoughts fragmenting, trying to hold concepts that human minds weren't designed to comprehend.

    *line_break

    But you [i]push[/i].

    *page_break

    For one crystalline moment, you see it.

    You understand the First Tongue—not all of it, but enough. You glimpse the fundamental structure of reality itself, written in runes that predate existence.

    *line_break

    Then your mind snaps back to safety, and the knowledge [i]burns[/i] itself into you.

    *page_break

    You collapse, gasping.

    The rune-figure kneels beside you.

You take the offered hands.

The world [i]inverts[/i].

*line_break

Suddenly you're not in the chamber anymore. You're [i]inside[/i] the glacier's consciousness.

You feel its vast, ancient awareness. You experience time the way it does—not as a river, but as a frozen lake where every moment exists simultaneously.

*page_break

You see the glacier's memories:

The First Tongue being spoken for the first time, creating magic from nothing.

Izack Thorne discovering dimensional theory and weeping with joy.

Hundreds of students who came seeking power, and the few who sought understanding instead.

*line_break

And you see yourself.

Not as you are now, but as you [i]could be[/i]. Dozens of possible futures branch out before you, each one shaped by choices you haven't made yet.

*page_break

The rune-figure's voice echoes through the vision:

[b]"This is Mystery, ${name}. Not the absence of knowledge, but the presence of infinite possibility. Every choice creates new futures. Every moment is a doorway to what could be."[/b]

*line_break

The vision fades.

You're back in the black ice chamber, but you're [i]changed[/i].

  When the transformation completes, you can feel the glacier as if it were part of your own body. Its runes swim through your consciousness, offering wisdom when you need it.

She tilts her head, studying you with one bright eye.

[i]"You've changed, ${name}. I can see it. The ice left its mark on you—for better or worse."[/i]

A portal opens behind you—the way back to Avalon Academy.

Theron gestures toward it.

[b]"Your expedition is complete. Return to the Academy. Your journey is not over—it has only just begun."[/b]

You step toward the portal, but pause at the threshold.

Looking back, you see Theron standing on the ice, their translucent form shimmering in the cold light. The runes beneath the surface pulse in rhythm—a heartbeat, a song, a mystery.

[i]"The glacier will remember you,"[/i] Theron calls out. [i]"As you will remember it."[/i]

*line_break

You step through the portal.

The warmth of Avalon Academy surrounds you like a blanket after the glacier's cold.

[b]== FREE TIME AT AVALON ==[/b]

*line_break

For once, you have no scheduled classes or mandatory training.

Avalon's intensive program rarely grants free time, but today is an exception—the masters are attending an important dimensional conference, and students have been given the day to pursue their own interests.

*page_break

Polly lands on your shoulder as you step into the courtyard.

*line_break

[i]"Free time! You know what that means—opportunity to get into interesting trouble. Or, if you're boring, you could study. But where's the fun in that?"[/i]

*page_break

You have several options for how to spend this rare gift of time:

*page_break

*choice
  *if not(library_visited)
    #Visit the Infinite Library—research magic and discover secrets.
      *set free_time_choice "library"
      *goto library_intro

  *if not(creature_gardens_visited)
    #Explore the Creature Gardens—meet magical beings.
      *set free_time_choice "creatures"
      *goto creatures_intro

  *if not(tournament_participated)
    #Sign up for the Harmonic Trials—test your collaborative skills.
      *set free_time_choice "tournament"
      *goto tournament_intro

  #Practice magic alone—work on individual techniques.
    *set free_time_choice "solo_practice"
    *goto solo_practice

  #Spend time with your training partner—strengthen your collaborative bond.
    *set free_time_choice "partner_time"
    *goto partner_practice

  #Rest and relax—you've been working hard and need a break.
    *set free_time_choice "rest"
    *goto rest_scene

[i]"The library!"[/i] Polly approves. [i]"Excellent choice. Nothing dangerous ever happens in libraries."[/i]

*line_break

She pauses.

*line_break

[i]"Okay, that's a lie. Lots of dangerous things happen in libraries. But they're [b]educational[/b] dangerous things."[/i]

*page_break

You head toward the magnificent crystal archway that marks the entrance to Avalon's Infinite Library.

*page_break

*page_break

You make your way to the gardens, passing through gates woven from living vines.

*line_break

The air here feels different—alive with the presence of beings from across the realms.

[i]"The Harmonic Trials!"[/i] Polly caws excitedly. [i]"Now we're talking! Competitive collaborative magic—the phrase itself is deliciously contradictory."[/i]

*page_break

You head to the Hall of Threads where students are gathering for the tournament announcement.

*line_break

The energy in the room is electric—excitement, nerves, determination all mixing together.

*page_break

  You study complex dimensional formulas, working through proofs and theoretical models.

*if class_focus = "practical"
  You practice portal creation and boundary manipulation, refining your technique.

*if class_focus = "living_magic"

*page_break

*line_break

When you emerge, you feel more confident in your individual abilities.

*page_break

[i]"Not bad,"[/i] Polly observes. [i]"Solo practice has its place. Just don't forget that Avalon is all about [b]not[/b] doing things solo."[/i]

*comment PARTNER PRACTICE
*comment ================================================

*label partner_practice

You find your training partner and spend the afternoon practicing collaborative techniques.

*page_break

  Lyra has prepared a detailed practice schedule.
  
  You work through precision exercises together, each pushing the other to be more exact, more refined.

*if training_partner = "kade"
  Kade suggests trying something ambitious (as usual).
  
  You spend the afternoon attempting collaborative spells that are technically above your level—failing often, but learning with each attempt.

*if training_partner = "zara"
  Zara leads you through nature-based collaborative exercises.
  
  Working with Thoughtvines and magical plants, you learn how collaboration extends beyond just human partners.

*page_break

By the end, your connection with your partner has deepened significantly.

*line_break

You're beginning to understand what Izack means about the Third Thread—magic that flows between minds, not just through them.

*page_break

*if dorm_style = "study"
  You put away your books and notes, allowing yourself to simply exist without learning for once.

*if dorm_style = "workshop"
  You tidy your workspace, then sit by the window, doing nothing productive for the first time in weeks.

*if dorm_style = "zen"
  You meditate in your minimalist space, finding center and calm.

*page_break

[i]"Rest is important too,"[/i] Polly says, uncharacteristically serious. [i]"Avalon's program is intense. Burning out helps no one."[/i]

*line_break

She settles beside you.

*line_break

[i]"You're doing well here, you know. Better than most students at this stage. Just... don't forget to breathe occasionally."[/i]

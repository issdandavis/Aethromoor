[b]== THE HARMONIC TRIALS ==[/b]

*line_break

*comment Visual Note: Izack per canon - amber eyes bright with excitement, gesturing with rune-scarred hands, robes' constellations shifting with his enthusiasm

Izack stands before the assembled students in the Grand Hall, and his excitement is palpable. His amber eyes are practically glowing—star-flecks dancing in their depths—and his hands move expressively as he speaks, trailing faint lines of dimensional energy. The constellations on his Transdimensional Reality Robes shift and swirl faster than usual, responding to his enthusiasm.

*page_break

[b]"Every year, Avalon hosts the Harmonic Trials—a competition that tests not individual power, but collaborative skill. This year, you're all eligible to participate."[/b]

*line_break

*comment Visual Note: Polly - iridescent feathers shimmer with sardonic amusement

Polly lands on a nearby perch carved from living crystal, her iridescent feathers catching the hall's magical lighting and refracting it into purple and green shimmer. [i]"Translation: it's a magical obstacle course designed to be impossible solo. You'll need partners, strategy, and actual teamwork to survive, let alone win."[/i]

*page_break

*comment Visual Note: Aria per canon - regal bearing, violet eyes analytical, ward-marks glowing faintly as she ensures the hall's safety

Aria steps forward, her silver-white braids swaying with graceful precision. Her violet eyes sweep the gathered students with analytical intensity, and you notice the ward-marks on her forearms glowing faintly—she's already ensuring the hall's protective barriers are strong enough for any excited magical outbursts. Her Boundary Ward Dress flows around her in deep purple and silver, making her look every bit the noble mage.

[b]"The Trials have three stages: Harmony, Crisis, and Synthesis. Each tests different aspects of collaboration. Teams of three will compete."[/b]

*line_break

*comment Visual Note: Zara per canon - heterochromatic eyes bright with excitement, flowers in hair blooming, scales shimmering

Zara grins, and her heterochromatic eyes sparkle—gold-amber left eye warm like dragon-fire, violet-blue right eye dancing with fae mischief. The living flowers woven into her silver-blue hair bloom fully in response to her excitement, tiny petals unfurling. Her subtle scales catch the light, shimmering with opalescent rainbow colors.

[b]"And the winning team gets to study advanced techniques with all three masters simultaneously. Plus bragging rights for a year."[/b]

[b]"Good to understand what you're getting into. Let me explain:"[/b]

*line_break

[b]"Stage One: Harmony. Teams must create a perfect three-way resonance while navigating a shifting dimensional maze. If anyone's magical frequency drops out of sync, you start over."[/b]

*page_break

Aria continues. [b]"Stage Two: Crisis. We throw unexpected problems at you—dimensional rifts, temporal loops, ethical dilemmas. You must solve them collaboratively under time pressure."[/b]

*page_break

Zara finishes. [b]"Stage Three: Synthesis. All teams work together on one massive collaborative spell. We judge not who's strongest, but who contributes most effectively to the collective effort."[/b]

Aria leads all teams to a massive dimensional construct.

The maze shifts and changes, walls appearing and disappearing based on magical resonance.

*page_break

[b]"The rules are simple,"[/b] she explains. [b]"Your team must maintain perfect three-way harmonic resonance while navigating to the center. If even one person drops out of sync, you return to the start."[/b]

[b]"Oh, and the maze actively tries to disrupt your harmony with distractions, illusions, and emotional triggers."[/b]

  Vex sees an illusion of himself being called weak. He surges with power, disrupting the resonance.

    "From now on, we move as one. No showing off. No ego. Team."

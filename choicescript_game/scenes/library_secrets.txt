[b]== THE INFINITE LIBRARY ==[/b]

*line_break

*comment Visual Note: Polly is described per canon - iridescent black feathers with purple/green shimmer, intelligent golden eyes, sardonic bearing

Polly lands on your shoulder as you approach Avalon's legendary library, her iridescent feathers catching the ambient magic and refracting it into impossible purples and greens. One golden eye fixes on you with that characteristic blend of ancient wisdom and sardonic amusement.

*page_break

[i]"The Infinite Library. Literally infinite—it extends through pocket dimensions. Students have gotten lost for days in the history section alone."[/i]

*line_break

The entrance is a magnificent archway carved from living crystal—each facet pulses with soft amber light, responding to the presence of seekers. Through it, you see endless rows of shelves that seem to curve upward into impossible geometries, defying Euclidean space with casual confidence.

*page_break

*comment Visual Note: Keeper Ves'thalan - ancient scholarly presence, spectacles of compressed starlight, robes that shimmer with contained knowledge

An ancient-looking mage greets you at the entrance. Keeper Ves'thalan's spectacles are crafted from compressed starlight—literal stars bound into lenses that allow him to read texts written in pure energy. His robes shimmer with faint glyphs, each one a snippet of contained knowledge, and his silver-white hair floats slightly as if underwater, responding to the currents of information flowing through the library.

[b]"Welcome, student. I am Keeper Ves'thalan. The library responds to genuine curiosity. What draws you here today?"[/b]

*comment THIRD THREAD RESEARCH
*comment ================================================

*label third_thread_research

The Third Thread section is breathtaking.

Books float in mid-air, connected by shimmering lines of magical energy. As you watch, two volumes drift together, their knowledge merging and creating a new tome that didn't exist before.

*page_break

[i]"The books collaborate,"[/i] Polly observes. [i]"Of course they do. Even the library practices what it teaches."[/i]

*line_break

You spend hours reading about collaborative magic across different cultures and eras.

*page_break

You discover:

*line_break

• The [b]Woven Way[/b] practiced by the ancient Fae, where multiple mages literally braided their life forces together to create permanent enchantments.

*line_break

• [b]Harmonic Resonance[/b] from the Singing Towers, where entire cities of mages synchronized their casting to maintain continent-wide protective barriers.

*line_break

• The [b]Collective Mind[/b] of Mir'kathos, a controversial technique where mages temporarily merged consciousness to solve impossible problems.

*page_break

But one book calls to you specifically—[b]Wingscroll Principles[/b] by Polymnia Aetheris herself.

*page_break

[i]"That's MY book,"[/i] Polly says, sounding embarrassed. [i]"I wrote it three hundred years ago when I was still... well, less cynical."[/i]

*line_break

You open it and read:

[i]"True collaboration isn't about losing yourself in others. It's about finding the spaces [b]between[/b] selves—the resonant harmonics where individual strengths amplify rather than diminish."[/i]

*page_break

*choice
  #Ask Polly to tell you more about what she learned writing this.
    *set polly_relationship +15
    *set collaboration +10

    Polly ruffles her feathers, clearly moved.

    [i]"You really want to know? Fine. I'll tell you about the old days..."[/i]

    *page_break

    For the next hour, Polly shares stories of the early days of Avalon. How Izack and Aria worked together despite completely different philosophies. How Zara became the bridge between traditions no one thought could coexist.

    *line_break

    [i]"Collaboration isn't easy,"[/i] she admits. [i]"It requires vulnerability. Trust. Accepting that you don't have all the answers. But when it works..."[/i]

    *line_break

    She goes quiet, lost in memory.

    [i]"When it works, you create something that couldn't exist any other way."[/i]

    *page_break

    *set discovery_made "polly_wisdom"
    *goto library_conclusion

  #Continue researching—there's so much more to learn.
    *set collaboration +15

    You spend the rest of the day absorbing everything you can.

    *page_break

    By evening, your mind is full of possibilities. Techniques you could try. Approaches you've never considered.

    *line_break

    The Third Thread isn't just a philosophy—it's a vast field of study with endless depth.

*comment BOUNDARY RESEARCH
*comment ================================================

*label boundary_research

The Boundary Theory archives are organized with frightening precision.

Every text is categorized by dimensional stability, temporal consistency, and magical density. Aria's personal notes fill entire shelves.

*page_break

You pull a volume titled [b]"The Architecture of Reality: Understanding Dimensional Membranes."[/b]

*line_break

It's dense, technical, brilliant.

*page_break

As you read, you begin to understand:

Boundaries aren't walls—they're more like [b]interfaces[/b]. Places where different realities negotiate their interaction.

*line_break

A well-crafted boundary is flexible, responsive, alive in its own way.

*page_break

You discover diagrams showing:

• How to identify weak points in dimensional fabric
• Techniques for reinforcing unstable boundaries
• Methods for creating permeable membranes that allow controlled passage

*page_break

One section catches your eye: [b]"Emergency Protocols for Catastrophic Boundary Failure."[/b]

*page_break

*choice
  #Study the emergency protocols—this could be crucial knowledge.
    *set aria_relationship +15
    *set boundary_expertise +20

    The protocols are terrifying in their implications.

    *page_break

    Catastrophic boundary failure doesn't just mean a portal opens—it means realities start [b]bleeding into each other[/b]. Physics becomes optional. Cause and effect stop working properly.

    *line_break

    But there are solutions. Complex, requiring multiple mages working in perfect coordination, but possible.

    *page_break

    [i]"You're studying the nightmare scenarios,"[/i] Polly observes. [i]"Smart. Hope you never need this knowledge, but if you do, you'll be ready."[/i]

    *page_break

    *set discovery_made "emergency_protocols"
    *goto library_conclusion

  #Focus on creative applications—boundaries as art, not just safety.
    *set collaboration +10
    *set creativity +15

    You shift to a different section: [b]"Aesthetic Dimensional Design."[/b]

    *page_break

    This is where Aria's technical precision meets genuine artistry.

    *line_break

    Boundaries can be beautiful. Shimmering membranes that display colors impossible in normal reality. Windows between worlds that frame breathtaking vistas.

    *page_break

    You learn about:

    • [b]Prismatic Boundaries[/b] that split light across dimensional spectrums
    • [b]Musical Membranes[/b] that hum with the frequency of the realms they connect
    • [b]Living Portals[/b] that grow and adapt like organisms

    *page_break

    [i]"Aria would love that you're exploring this,"[/i] Polly says. [i]"She doesn't talk about it much, but boundaries as art is her secret passion."[/i]

*comment ECOSYSTEM RESEARCH
*comment ================================================

*label ecosystem_research

The Natural Magic collection is alive—literally.

Vines grow along the shelves. Bioluminescent moss provides gentle lighting. Small creatures that might be bookmarks or might be tiny nature spirits flit between volumes.

*page_break

Keeper Ves'thalan hands you a book that feels warm and pulses like a heartbeat.

[b]"The Verdant Codex. A living text that grows as the realms' ecosystems evolve."[/b]

*page_break

You open it and gasp.

The pages show moving images: forests breathing, oceans thinking, deserts dreaming. You can feel the life force of entire ecosystems flowing through the book.

*page_break

You learn about:

*line_break

• [b]Thoughtvine Networks[/b] that connect all plant life in a realm into a single distributed consciousness

*line_break

• [b]Emotion Tides[/b] in magical oceans that respond to the feelings of nearby beings

*line_break

• [b]Memory Crystals[/b] in desert sand that record everything that happens and share it with those who listen

*page_break

But one entry fascinates you most: [b]"Symbiotic Magic: When Mages and Ecosystems Merge."[/b]

*page_break

*choice
  #Study the symbiotic techniques—become one with nature.
    *set zara_relationship +15
    *set nature_affinity +25

    You discover that some mages achieve such deep connection with ecosystems that the boundary between self and nature dissolves.

    *page_break

    They don't just communicate with forests—they [b]are[/b] part of the forest. Rivers flow through their veins. Mountains stabilize their bones.

    *line_break

    It's beautiful. Powerful. And slightly terrifying.

    *page_break

    [i]"Zara's heading in this direction,"[/i] Polly observes. [i]"She's not fully there yet, but give her another decade and she'll be more ecosystem than individual."[/i]

    *line_break

    [i]"Not sure if that's beautiful or sad. Maybe both."[/i]

    *page_break

    You practice the basic exercises: feeling your heartbeat sync with tree growth, breathing in rhythm with wind patterns, listening to the slow thoughts of stone.

    *page_break

    *set discovery_made "symbiotic_magic"
    *goto library_conclusion

  #Focus on healing ecosystems—restoration and balance.
    *set collaboration +10
    *set healer_affinity +20

    You find texts about [b]Ecological Restoration Magic[/b].

    *page_break

    How to heal poisoned land. Revive dying forests. Restore balance to ecosystems disrupted by dimensional rifts or magical disasters.

    *line_break

    This is healing on a massive scale—not fixing individuals but curing entire living systems.

    *page_break

    [i]"Noble work,"[/i] Polly says quietly. [i]"The realms need more healers. Everyone wants to create or destroy. Few have the patience to restore."[/i]

    *page_break

    You learn techniques for:

    • Encouraging Thoughtvines to reconnect severed networks
    • Cleansing corrupted leylines that poison ecosystems
    • Reintroducing extinct species through collaborative nature magic

*comment HIDDEN STACKS
*comment ================================================

*label hidden_stacks

Keeper Ves'thalan leads you through a series of increasingly impossible doorways.

One is sideways. Another only exists when you're not looking directly at it. The third requires solving a riddle that changes each time someone approaches.

*page_break

[i]"The Hidden Stacks,"[/i] he explains, [i]"contain knowledge the library itself isn't sure about. Theories too dangerous to publish. Spells that work but no one knows why. Prophecies that might be nonsense or might be terrifyingly accurate."[/i]

*page_break

[i]"Oh, this is going to be good,"[/i] Polly mutters.

*page_break

The Hidden Stacks are chaos organized by some logic you can't quite grasp.

Books float randomly. Shelves rearrange themselves. Time feels optional—you could swear you've been here for hours and also for no time at all.

*page_break

Three books catch your attention simultaneously:

*page_break

*choice
  #A book bound in shadows: "Varn'ka'zul: The Demon Realm's True Nature"

  #A book that sings: "The Fae Song and the Language of Creation"

    *set research_topic "prophecy"
    *goto prophecy_research

*comment ================================================
*comment DEMON REALM RESEARCH
*comment ================================================

*label demon_research

You open the shadow-bound book, and immediately the temperature drops.

*page_break

Varn'ka'zul—the demon realm. Even the name feels wrong in your mouth.

*page_break

But as you read, you realize the book isn't promoting demons—it's explaining them with uncomfortable honesty.

*line_break

[i]"Demons aren't evil incarnate. They're beings from a realm where consciousness works differently. What we call cruelty, they experience as efficiency. What we call connection, they perceive as weakness."[/i]

*page_break

You learn that dimensional barriers between realms aren't just physical—they're [b]philosophical[/b]. Each realm operates on different fundamental assumptions about reality.

*page_break

[i]"Be careful with that knowledge,"[/i] Polly warns. [i]"Understanding demons doesn't mean trusting them. Izack made that mistake once. Nearly died."[/i]

*page_break

The book describes:

• How demons manipulate boundaries by exploiting contradictions
• Why collaborative magic is anathema to demon philosophy
• The one technique that can seal demonic incursions permanently

*page_break

The moment you open the singing book, music fills the air.

Not just sound—[b]creative force made audible[/b]. The Fae Song.

*page_break

[i]"The language that shaped the realms,"[/i] the book explains in words that shimmer and dance. [i]"Before there was structure, there was song. Before there were boundaries, there was harmony."[/i]

*page_break

You learn that reality itself is musical at its deepest level.

Everything has a frequency. Every action is a note in an infinite composition.

*line_break

The Fae discovered this truth and learned to [b]sing new realities into existence[/b].

*page_break

[i]"Dangerous knowledge,"[/i] Polly says, but she sounds awed. [i]"The Fae Song isn't just magic—it's the code reality runs on. Learn it, and you can rewrite the rules."[/i]

*page_break

The book teaches you a single phrase of the Fae Song.

Just one line of the infinite melody.

But when you hum it experimentally, the air around you [b]ripples[/b].

*comment ================================================

*label prophecy_research

The self-rewriting book is maddening and fascinating.

Every time you try to read a prophecy, it changes. But patterns emerge if you don't focus too hard.

*page_break

[i]"Prophecies of the Spiral Thread,"[/i] you read. Or think you read. The words shift.

*page_break

You catch glimpses:

*line_break

[i]"...when three threads become one..."[/i]

[i]"...the bridge between worlds will choose..."[/i]

[i]"...collaboration or consumption, there is no middle path..."[/i]

*page_break

One passage stays stable long enough to read completely:

*line_break

[b]"In the hour of greatest need, when boundaries fail and collaboration falters, one student will stand at the convergence. Their choice will echo across all realms. Choose wisely, Spiral-touched. Your story has just begun."[/b]

*page_break

[i]"That's about you,"[/i] Polly says quietly. [i]"The prophecy stabilized when you touched it. It's [b]about you[/b]."[/i]

You feel a weight settle on your shoulders—not burden, but [b]significance[/b].

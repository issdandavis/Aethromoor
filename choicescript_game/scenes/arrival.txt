You walk through the crystalline gate, feeling the leyline energy wash over you like warm water. It tingles across your skin, welcoming and ancient, carrying whispers of a thousand magical conversations.

*comment Visual Note: Izack Thorne per canon - dark-skinned elf (appears mid-30s, actually 112), shoulder-length wild dark hair with silver touches, amber eyes that shift/glow during magic, 6'2" lean, rune-scars on hands, Transdimensional Reality Robes (midnight blue with shifting constellations)

Izack Thorne stands in the courtyard—and he's exactly as the stories described yet somehow more. Tall and lean at over six feet, his dark skin seems to glow faintly in Avalon's magical ambiance. His shoulder-length hair is wild and dark, touched with silver at the temples as if static electricity constantly runs through it, responding to the dimensional currents he commands. When his amber eyes meet yours, they seem to shift—deepening to gold, flickering with star-flecks that suggest he's seeing not just you, but all the possible yous across nearby timelines.

His Transdimensional Reality Robes flow around him in deep midnight blue, the fabric itself alive with shifting constellations and golden runes that rearrange themselves in response to magical currents. Small glowing rune-scars mark his hands—the price of experimental magic—and his fingers are ink-stained from constant note-taking.

His presence is gentle but undeniably powerful—like standing near the ocean. You know it could be devastating, but right now it's just beautiful and welcoming.

"Welcome," he says warmly, his voice carrying that peculiar resonance of someone who speaks multiple magical languages fluently. "I'm Izack. You must be ${name}. How are you feeling after the portal crossing?"

*comment Visual Note: Polly (Polymnia Aetheris) per canon - large raven with iridescent black feathers (purple/green shimmer), intelligent golden eyes, often on Izack's shoulder, sardonic personality

[i]*Perched on his shoulder, I ruffle my iridescent feathers—they catch the leyline light and refract it into impossible purples and greens.*[/i]

"Oh good, we got a polite one. Those are always fun to watch when they realize magic here doesn't care about your manners."

*line_break

Izack shoots me a look—one I've seen a thousand times. Fond exasperation. His amber eyes soften as he glances at the ancient raven who's been his companion for decades.

"What Polly means is that magic responds to intention and collaboration, not formality. But courtesy is always appreciated."

He gestures toward the soaring academy structures beyond—his hand moving in that characteristic way of his, fingers tracing patterns in the air as if conducting invisible symphonies.

"Your first lesson begins shortly. We'll be exploring the nature of magical boundaries—specifically, how they can be [i]bridged[/i] rather than broken."

  #Express excitement about learning collaborative techniques.

    Your eyes light up. "That sounds incredible. I've always believed magic works better when we work together."

    Izack's smile deepens. "Then you're already halfway to understanding Avalon's core principle."

    *goto first_lesson_setup

  #Ask if you'll learn individual magic too—you want to be self-sufficient.
    *set lesson_approach "balanced"
    *set aria_relationship +10

    "Will we also learn individual techniques?" you ask. "I believe in collaboration, but self-sufficiency is important too."

    Izack nods thoughtfully. "A pragmatic approach. Aria will appreciate that perspective."

[i]I hop closer, my feathers catching the leyline light and refracting it into impossible colors.[/i]

"Smart. Ask the raven who's been here since the beginning. I like you already."

*line_break

Here's what you need to know, ${name}:

Avalon is [i]alive[/i]. Not metaphorically—Izack literally created a sentient dimensional realm that grows from the World Tree. The magic here works through collaboration, which means your success depends on how well you listen to the currents, your fellow students, and yes, even the cranky raven.

*line_break

[i]I tilt my head, one eye fixing you with ancient intelligence.[/i]

Izack will teach you to [i]feel[/i] magic rather than force it. Aria—his wife, brilliant politician turned boundary mage—will teach you precision and control. Zara, their first student, will probably befriend you because she's annoyingly nice. And I'll keep you honest.

*page_break

*comment Visual Note: Zara per canon - hybrid (draconic/elven/fae bloodlines), early 20s, warm brown skin with subtle scales, silver-blue hair in natural waves, heterochromatic eyes (gold-amber left, violet-blue right), nature-attuned clothing with living vines

Just then, a young woman approaches—and she's beautiful in a way that defies singular classification. Zara is clearly hybrid, her heritage written in every striking feature: pointed elven ears, yes, but also the faintest shimmer of draconic scales along her warm brown cheekbones that catch the light like opals. Her silver-blue hair falls in natural waves to mid-back, adorned with tiny flowers that seem to bloom and close in response to her emotions.

But it's her eyes that truly capture you—heterochromatic and mesmerizing. Her left eye burns gold-amber like dragon-fire, while her right shimmers violet-blue like twilight sky. She wears nature-attuned clothing—earth-toned fabrics interwoven with living vines that respond to her presence, leaves unfurling gently along her shoulders.

She radiates an aura of belonging to multiple worlds at once—comfortable in her in-betweenness, proud of being bridge between traditions.

"Hi! You must be new. I'm Zara." Her smile is genuinely warm, lighting up both eyes with different but equally welcoming glows. "Polly giving you the full orientation?"

    "Thank you, Polly," you say sincerely, then turn to Zara. "What's it been like for you here?"

    Zara's face lights up. "It's been incredible! I was the first student here—came from a hybrid bloodline that didn't fit anywhere else. Avalon was the first place that celebrated what I am instead of asking me to choose."

    *goto zara_friendship

  #Ask Zara about the different magical traditions taught here.
    *set lesson_approach "studious"
    *set aria_relationship +5

    "What traditions does Avalon teach?" you ask. "I want to understand the curriculum."

    Zara nods enthusiastically. "We integrate everything—dimensional magic, boundary work, elemental traditions, even the old ways from the Verdant Tithe..."

You stride through the gate with purpose. You've read about Avalon, studied dimensional theory, and you're ready to prove yourself.

A woman with sharp eyes and elegant bearing steps into your path. Her presence radiates controlled power—this is someone who knows exactly where every boundary lies and how to manipulate them.

"Aria Ravencrest," she introduces herself, voice cool and assessing. "Co-founder, boundary specialist, and the person who makes sure enthusiastic students don't accidentally collapse dimensional barriers."

*line_break

[i]"That's Izack's wife. She's the reason Avalon hasn't imploded from all the experimental magic. Show some respect."[/i]

*line_break

Aria's expression softens slightly—though her eyes remain evaluating.

"Confidence is good. Overconfidence in dimensional magic is how you end up scattered across three realities." She crosses her arms. "Let me ask you something: what do you think is more important—controlling magic, or understanding it?"

*choice
  #Controlling it—power without control is dangerous.
    *set lesson_approach "control"
    *set aria_relationship +15
    *set collaboration -5

    "Control," you answer firmly. "Power without discipline is just chaos waiting to happen."

    Aria nods thoughtfully. "A practical answer. I've spent years mastering boundary magic precisely because uncontrolled dimensional rifts are catastrophic."

    *goto aria_control_path

  #Understanding it—you can't work with something you don't comprehend.
    *set lesson_approach "understanding"
    *set collaboration +15

    *set izack_relationship +5

    "Understanding," you say. "You can force magic to obey, but if you don't understand it, that control is brittle."

    Aria's expression shifts to genuine warmth. "Exactly. You can force magic to obey, but it will fight you every step. Understand it, and it becomes a willing partner."

    *goto aria_understanding_path

  #Both equally—they inform each other.
    *set lesson_approach "balanced"
    *set aria_relationship +15
    *set collaboration +5

    "Both," you answer. "They're not opposites—they inform each other. Understanding gives you better control; control lets you test your understanding."

    Aria actually smiles. "Well reasoned. You'll do well here."

[i]*I watch from Izack's shoulder, observing the easy rapport forming.*[/i]

"She's not exaggerating. Zara's the bridge between traditions. Also, she'll probably want to study with you, so prepare for that."

*line_break

Zara laughs. "Polly's right. I love working with other students. Magic here is so much stronger when we combine our approaches. My hybrid heritage lets me see connections others miss."

She gestures toward a crystalline building that pulses with soft light.

"Come on, first lesson's about to start. Izack's teaching today—dimensional resonance and collaborative casting."

*page_break

As you walk together through the courtyard, you notice leylines glowing beneath the stones, all converging toward the central Spiral Spire. The air hums with potential.

This is really happening. You're at Avalon Academy.

*comment ================================================

*label aria_control_path

"But," Aria continues, her tone shifting to teaching mode, "control without understanding is brittle. It breaks under pressure. Izack taught me that magic isn't about domination—it's about partnership."

She places a hand on your shoulder.

"You have the discipline for power. Let me teach you the wisdom to use it well. Come—your first lesson awaits."

*line_break

[i]"Translation: Aria likes you but thinks you're going to learn the hard way. I've seen this before. It's educational."[/i]

*label aria_understanding_path

[i]*I actually look impressed—which doesn't happen often.*[/i]

"Congratulations, you passed Aria's test. She and Izack are going to love you."

*line_break

Aria smiles—a rare, genuine expression. "Polly's not wrong. That's the philosophy at Avalon's core. Magic is alive—it has currents, rhythms, preferences. Learning to [i]listen[/i] to those is more powerful than any control technique."

She guides you toward the academy proper.

"Izack's teaching the first lesson today. You'll practice dimensional resonance—feeling the boundaries between realities and learning to work [i]with[/i] them, not against them."

*line_break

[i]"Fair warning: this is where things get weird. Dimensional magic feels like falling while standing still. Just go with it."[/i]

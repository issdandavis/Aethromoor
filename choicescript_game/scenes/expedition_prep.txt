*label expedition_prep
*comment This scene is called when the player is invited to join the Verdant Tithe expedition.

Polly lands on your shoulder as you read the expedition notice posted outside the Guild Hall.  
"Verdant Tithe," she reads. "A test of collaboration, trust, and the ability to not get eaten by flora. Fun."

Izack and Aria stand at a nearby table covered in maps and supply lists.  
"The Verdant Tithe is more than just a field trip," Izack says. "It's a rite of passage for Avalon students. We need volunteers to fill different roles."

Aria lays out three role cards. "Scout," "Mage," and "Heart."  
She looks at you. "Which role resonates with you?"

*choice
    #Scout – navigate, perceive, and sense danger.
        *set expedition_role "scout"
        *set perception +3
        *set agility +3
        "The forest is alive," Aria warns. "You'll need to listen more than you look."
        *goto choose_equipment
    #Mage – maintain spells, reinforce wards, and handle magical hurdles.
        *set expedition_role "mage"
        *set magic_control +3
        *set academics +2
        "The Tithe respects those who respect it," Izack adds. "Weave your spells with invitations, not commands."
        *goto choose_equipment
    #Heart – foster group cohesion, morale, and empathy.
        *set expedition_role "heart"
        *set empathy +4
        *set collaboration +2
        "You'll be responsible for holding us together," Aria says. "The Verdant Tithe tests relationships as much as skill."
        *goto choose_equipment

*label choose_equipment
The supply table holds an assortment of gear, each resonating with different skill sets.

*comment Each choice modifies stats and the type of challenges the player can handle.

*choice
    #Pick the Alchemical Satchel – potions and salves for healing and enhancement.
        *set equipment_chosen "alchemical_satchel"
        *set magic_control +2
        *set academics +1
        "Brewed by the Cassisi Lab," Izack says. "They do wonders for headaches and vine burns."  
        *goto mental_preparation
    #Grab the Runethic Toolkit – carving tools and rune stones.
        *set equipment_chosen "runethic_toolkit"
        *set knowledge +2
        *set power +1
        "Remember: runes like straight lines and clear intent," Aria reminds you.  
        *goto mental_preparation
    #Choose the Spirit Flute – attunes you to plant and animal spirits.
        *set equipment_chosen "spirit_flute"
        *set empathy +2
        *set magic_control +2
        Zara passes you the flute. "It will help you hear what the Verdant Tithe is saying. Listen closely."  
        *goto mental_preparation
    #Take the Multi-Tool Drone – Cassisivadan gadget that repairs and scouts.
        *set equipment_chosen "multi_tool_drone"
        *set creativity +2
        *set agility +1
        The little device buzzes around your head, chirping in an excited rhythm. "You'll need to talk to it in Cassisivadan," Polly notes.
        *goto mental_preparation

*label mental_preparation
Polly eyes you. "Mindset matters as much as gear," she says. "How are you approaching this expedition?"

*choice
    #With cautious optimism. I trust my team and the forest.
        *set mental_preparation "optimistic"
        *set stress -3
        You breathe deeply and visualize the Verdant Tithe as an ally, not an enemy.  
        "Good," Polly says. "The forest hears intentions."
        *goto expedition_brief
    #With intellectual curiosity. I want to study everything we encounter.
        *set mental_preparation "curious"
        *set academics +2
        You mentally prepare to take notes on every plant, creature, and resonance.  
        "Just don't wander off chasing research," Aria warns.
        *goto expedition_brief
    #With nerves and trepidation. I'm not sure I'm ready.
        *set mental_preparation "nervous"
        *set stress +3
        *set collaboration +1
        You find your hands shaking slightly and your heart racing.  
        Izack places a reassuring hand on your shoulder. "Everyone feels that way their first time," he says.
        *goto expedition_brief
    #With determination. The Spiral prepared me for this.
        *set mental_preparation "determined"
        *set power +2
        *set individual_power +2
        You clench your fists and resolve to face whatever the Tithe throws at you.  
        "Let's hope it doesn't throw too hard," Polly mutters.
        *goto expedition_brief

*label expedition_brief
With role, gear, and mindset chosen, you gather with the expedition team at dawn. Izack, Aria, Zara, Rupert, and several other students stand in a semicircle.  
Polly flaps to the center. "Repeat after me," she says. "*Sil'na med'thara. Kor'val thul'ael.*" You intone the Kor'aelin invocation, feeling the air chill and taste faintly of mint.  
The Spiral hums in approval.  

Aria passes you a sealed envelope. "For emergencies," she says. "Do not open unless absolutely necessary."  
Zara checks her pack of herbs and runes. Rupert adjusts his dueling coat again.  

"The Verdant Tithe awaits," Izack announces. "Let's move out."

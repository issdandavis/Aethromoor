[b]== THE DAY BEFORE THE EXPEDITION ==[/b]

*line_break

Izack calls an assembly in the Hall of Threads.

All first-year students gather, buzzing with nervous excitement. This is it—the moment everyone's been preparing for.

*page_break

[b]"Tomorrow,"[/b] Izack begins, [b]"you'll each journey to one of Avalon's pocket dimensions for your first solo expedition."[/b]

*line_break

A murmur runs through the assembled students.

[b]"You've learned theory. You've practiced techniques. But there's no substitute for real experience. You'll face challenges that can't be simulated in a classroom."[/b]

*page_break

Aria steps forward.

[b]"Three realms are open to first-years: the Singing Dunes, the Verdant Tithe, and the Rune Glacier. Each tests different aspects of dimensional magic. Choose wisely."[/b]

*line_break

Zara adds:

[b]"You won't be in danger—we monitor all expeditions closely. But you will be challenged. Pushed to your limits. And what you learn there will shape your entire magical career."[/b]

*page_break

Polly, perched on your shoulder, mutters:

[i]"This is the dramatic part where they tell you it's dangerous but safe. Classic teacher contradiction."[/i]

*page_break

After the assembly, you're called to a private meeting with your chosen mentor.

*if class_focus = "theory"

  *goto izack_meeting

*if class_focus = "living_magic"
  *goto zara_meeting

*label aria_meeting

*set mentor_advice "aria"

You meet Aria in her library office.

Books line every wall, some of them hovering in mid-air, others rearranging themselves autonomously.

*page_break

[b]"Sit,"[/b] she says, gesturing to a chair.

You sit.

She studies you for a moment, her sharp eyes assessing.

*page_break

[b]"You've excelled in theory,"[/b] she says. [b]"You understand the [i]why[/i] behind dimensional magic. That's valuable. But tomorrow, theory alone won't be enough."[/b]

*line_break

She pulls out a detailed map of the three realms.

[b]"The Singing Dunes will test your honesty. The Verdant Tithe will test your connection to living magic. The Rune Glacier will test your ability to understand ancient power."[/b]

*page_break

She points to the Singing Dunes.

[b]"For someone with your theoretical background, I'd recommend the Dunes. The desert judges truth—and truth is something you've learned to recognize through rigorous study."[/b]

*line_break

She pauses.

[b]"But the choice is yours. Trust your knowledge, ${name}. You've earned it."[/b]

*set aria_relationship +5
*goto preparation_choice

*label izack_meeting

*set mentor_advice "izack"

You meet Izack in his workshop.

Dimensional threads float through the air like luminous spider silk. He's casually manipulating three different pocket dimensions simultaneously while eating a sandwich.

*page_break

[b]"Hey, ${name}!"[/b] He dismisses the dimensional work with a wave. [b]"Excited for tomorrow?"[/b]

You admit you're nervous.

[b]"Good! Nerves mean you're taking it seriously."[/b]

*page_break

He gestures to a floating hologram showing all three realms.

[b]"You've been excellent at practical work. You [i]feel[/i] magic naturally. That's rare."[/b]

*line_break

He points to each realm in turn.

[b]"The Singing Dunes rewards honesty and emotional truth. The Verdant Tithe rewards connection and relationship. The Rune Glacier rewards both control and partnership."[/b]

*page_break

He grins.

[b]"For someone who collaborates as naturally as you do, I'd lean toward either the Tithe or the Glacier. But honestly? Follow your instincts. They've served you well so far."[/b]

*line_break

[b]"Trust the magic, ${name}. It wants to work with you."[/b]

*set izack_relationship +5
*goto preparation_choice

*label zara_meeting

*set mentor_advice "zara"

You meet Zara in the gardens.

She's tending to a Thoughtvine that's grown remarkably large, its purple flowers blooming in response to her gentle touch.

*page_break

[b]"Come, walk with me,"[/b] she says.

You walk through paths lined with magical plants, each one humming with life and dimensional energy.

*page_break

[b]"You have a gift for living magic,"[/b] Zara says quietly. [b]"You don't just [i]use[/i] magic—you [i]relate[/i] to it. That's rare, especially in first-years."[/b]

*line_break

She stops by a fountain where all three realms are visible in the water's reflection.

*page_break

[b]"The Singing Dunes will challenge your honesty with yourself. The Verdant Tithe will offer you deep connection with living power. The Rune Glacier will test whether you can partner with ancient, alien consciousness."[/b]

*line_break

She touches the water, and the image shifts to show the Verdant Tithe.

[b]"For someone who understands relationship as you do, I think the Tithe would welcome you. But any path can teach you what you need to learn."[/b]

*page_break

She smiles warmly.

[b]"Trust your heart, ${name}. It's guided you well so far."[/b]

*goto preparation_choice

*label preparation_choice

*page_break

You have until morning to prepare.

You can focus your preparation in one area to give yourself an advantage:

*page_break

*choice
  #Study the realm's history and theory—knowledge is power.
    *set preparation_focus "research"
    *set collaboration +5

    You spend the evening in the library.

    *if class_focus = "theory"
      Your theoretical training makes parsing the complex texts easier.

    *line_break

    You read everything you can about all three realms—their formation, their rules, their past expeditions.

    *page_break

    You learn that the Singing Dunes were created to test authenticity. That the Verdant Tithe grows in response to emotional bonds. That the Rune Glacier remembers every mage who's ever walked on it.

    *line_break

    Knowledge won't solve everything, but it will help you make informed choices.

    *page_break

    Aria finds you late at night, still reading.

    [b]"Good,"[/b] she says simply. [b]"Preparation matters."[/b]

    *goto equipment_selection

  #Practice meditation and dimensional sensing—be in peak magical condition.
    *set preparation_focus "meditation"
    *set collaboration +10

    You spend the evening in your meditation space.

    *if dorm_style = "zen"
      Your minimalist room provides the perfect environment.

    *line_break

    You practice sensing dimensional boundaries, calming your mind, preparing yourself mentally and magically.

    *page_break

    You work on being [i]present[/i]—not anxious about tomorrow, not dwelling on past lessons, just [i]here[/i], now, centered.

    *line_break

    True magical power comes from clarity, not force.

    *page_break

    *if class_focus = "practical"
      Izack checks on you and nods approvingly.

      [b]"Perfect. You're ready."[/b]

    *if class_focus != "practical"
      You feel the dimensional threads around you more clearly than ever before.

      You're as ready as you'll ever be.

    *goto equipment_selection

  #Talk to other students who've done expeditions—learn from experience.
    *set preparation_focus "community"
    *set collaboration +15

    You spend the evening talking to second-year students.

    *if training_partner = "lyra"
      Lyra helps you find students who approached expeditions methodically.

    *if training_partner = "kade"
      Kade introduces you to students who took risks and thrived.

    *if training_partner = "selene"
      Selene points you toward students who excelled competitively.

    *page_break

    You hear dozens of stories.

    Marcus tells you about his Verdant Tithe expedition, where a Thoughtvine showed him his own future. A student named Cassandra describes the Rune Glacier's impossible beauty and alien intelligence. Another student, Tomas, laughs about how the Singing Dunes called him out on a lie he'd been telling himself for years.

    *page_break

    Everyone's experience was different.

    But they all emphasize the same thing: [i]Be honest. Be open. Be willing to collaborate.[/i]

    *page_break

    You return to your room feeling connected to a community of learners.

    You're not alone in this.

    *goto equipment_selection

*label equipment_selection

*page_break

Finally, you need to choose what to bring.

Each student can carry one magical tool from the Academy's equipment vault:

*page_break

*choice
  #A compass that points toward areas of high dimensional activity.
    *set equipment_choice "compass"

    You select the dimensional compass.

    It's a beautiful brass instrument that hums with captured energy. Instead of pointing north, it points toward the strongest dimensional currents.

    *line_break

    This will help you navigate and find important locations in whichever realm you choose.

    *page_break

    The equipment master, an older mage named Thaddeus, nods approval.

    [b]"Practical choice. Navigation matters when you're in an unfamiliar dimension."[/b]

    *goto final_preparations

  #A journal that records magical impressions automatically.
    *set equipment_choice "journal"
    *set collaboration +5

    You select the impression journal.

    It's a leather-bound book that looks ordinary, but when you open it, pages fill themselves with notes about nearby magic—documenting dimensional currents, magical signatures, anything notable.

    *line_break

    This will help you learn and remember everything you experience.

    *page_break

    Thaddeus smiles.

    [b]"Scholar's choice. Good for those who value understanding over pure power."[/b]

    *goto final_preparations

  #A resonance crystal that helps you sense emotional/magical connections.
    *set equipment_choice "crystal"
    *set collaboration +10

    You select the resonance crystal.

    It's a small, multifaceted gem that warms when you're near compatible magical energy or beings who might become allies.

    *line_break

    This will help you identify opportunities for collaboration and partnership.

    *page_break

    Thaddeus's eyebrows rise.

    [b]"Interesting. Most students choose navigation or protection. You chose [i]connection[/i]. I respect that."[/b]

    *goto final_preparations

*label final_preparations

*page_break

Everything is ready.

You return to your room one last time before tomorrow.

*if has_familiar_perch
  Polly is waiting on her perch, unusually quiet.

*line_break

[i]"So,"[/i] she says. [i]"Tomorrow you step into your first real challenge. Nervous?"[/i]

*page_break

You admit that yes, you're nervous.

[i]"Good. Fear keeps you alert. Just don't let it paralyze you."[/i]

*line_break

She hops closer.

[i]"I'll be with you, obviously. Can't have my narrator's subject dying in their first expedition. Would make for a very short story."[/i]

*page_break

Despite her sarcasm, there's genuine care in her voice.

[i]"You've learned a lot in these weeks, ${name}. More than most. I think... I think you're going to surprise people tomorrow."[/i]

*line_break

[i]"Now get some sleep. You'll need it."[/i]

*page_break

You lie in bed, looking up at the ceiling.

*if magical_feature = "memory_crystal"
  You touch your memory crystal, recording this moment—the anticipation, the nervousness, the excitement.

*line_break

Tomorrow, everything changes.

Tomorrow, you'll prove what you're capable of.

*page_break

[b]== EXPEDITION DAY ==[/b]

*line_break

Morning arrives.

You stand in the portal chamber with other first-years, each preparing to enter their chosen realm.

*page_break

Izack, Aria, and Zara stand together, ready to open the portals.

[b]"Remember,"[/b] Izack says, [b]"there are no wrong choices. Only different paths to understanding."[/b]

*line_break

Aria adds: [b]"Trust your knowledge."[/b]

Zara finishes: [b]"Trust your heart."[/b]

*page_break

Three portals shimmer into existence:

• The Singing Dunes—golden sand and impossible truth
• The Verdant Tithe—living forest and deep connection
• The Rune Glacier—ancient ice and alien wisdom

*page_break

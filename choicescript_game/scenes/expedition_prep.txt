The summons arrives at breakfast—a shimmering scroll that materializes in the air above your porridge, causing several students to gasp and one unfortunate soul to spill tea down their robes.

[i]"Ooh, fancy. They usually just post these on bulletin boards, but I guess Izack wanted to add drama. Always the showman."[/i]

Polly pecks the scroll open with her beak. The script glows in three colors—golden sand, emerald leaves, and crystalline blue.

[b]EXPEDITION SUMMONS[/b]

[i]Advanced students are hereby invited to participate in one of three field expeditions departing tomorrow at dawn. These expeditions are dangerous, educational, and will fundamentally shape your understanding of collaborative magic. Prepare accordingly.[/i]

You spend the rest of breakfast reading about the three options:

[b]The Singing Dunes[/b] — A truth-testing desert where the sand judges honesty. Guide: Kael, desert sage and oath-binder.

[b]The Verdant Tithe[/b] — A sentient forest where thoughts have weight. Guide: Izack Thorne, dimensional mage.

[b]The Rune Glacier[/b] — Living ice inscribed with adaptive runes. Guide: Aria Cassisi, boundary specialist.

The afternoon sun slants through the Guild Hall's crystalline windows as you make your way to the Expedition Preparation Wing. The corridors here smell of oiled leather, dried herbs, and something sharp that might be enchanted metal or might be nervous student sweat.

Other students cluster in small groups, their voices echoing off stone walls as they debate which expedition to choose.

*line_break

"—heard the Dunes can literally smell lies—"

"—my cousin tried the Glacier and came back with frostbite [i]on his thoughts[/i]—"

*line_break

Izack and Aria stand at the entrance to the Preparation Hall, checking students off a list. They both look up as you approach.

"${name}," Izack says warmly. "Ready to make your choice?"

Aria's gaze is more analytical. "Before you decide which expedition, you need to understand what you're preparing [i]for[/i]. Each journey tests different aspects of magical partnership."

        Izack smiles approvingly. "Good question. Let's walk through the Preparation Hall while we talk."
        
        He gestures for you to follow, leading you past tables laden with expedition gear.

        Aria nods. "Confidence is useful. Just ensure it doesn't become recklessness."
        
        [i]"Translation: you're eager, which is cute, but you don't actually know what you're getting into yet. Don't worry, that'll change."[/i]

        Izack's expression softens. "Everyone is. The expeditions are designed to challenge you. But you won't be alone."
        
        He places a reassuring hand on your shoulder. "Come on. Let's see what we can do to help you feel ready."

The Preparation Hall is vast—a cathedral of supplies and magical equipment. Vaulted ceilings rise overhead, inscribed with protective runes that pulse softly with blue-white light. The air hums with latent enchantments.

Tables are organized by expedition type: golden desert gear to the left, verdant forest supplies in the center, crystalline glacier equipment to the right.

*line_break

Other students move between the tables, testing the weight of enchanted packs, examining vials of alchemical mixtures, running fingers over runestones.

You recognize Zara at the forest supplies table, carefully selecting dried herbs. Rupert stands near the glacier equipment, looking simultaneously excited and terrified.

*page_break

[i]"Notice how the room's organized by fear category? Desert fear over there, forest fear in the middle, ice fear to the right. Very efficient."[/i]

*line_break

Aria gestures to the various stations. "Each expedition requires different preparations, but there are common elements. Physical endurance. Mental resilience. Collaborative capacity."

Izack adds, "But before you choose specific gear, you need to understand your role. Not just in the expedition, but in [i]any[/i] collaborative magical work."

*page_break

He leads you to a quiet alcove where three crystalline mirrors hang on the wall. Each reflects your image differently—one shows you alert and watchful, another shows you surrounded by swirling magical energy, the third shows you with arms open, connecting threads of light between other figures.

"The three aspects of collaborative magic," Izack explains. "Observation. Action. Connection."

*line_break

[i]"Some people call them Scout, Mage, and Heart. Some call them the Perceiver, the Weaver, and the Binder. Izack once tried to rename them the 'Trinity of Awesome' but Aria vetoed that immediately."[/i]

*page_break

Aria actually cracks a small smile at that. "Every expedition team needs balance. You'll need to decide which aspect resonates most with your natural strengths."

*choice
    #Study the watchful mirror—observation and perception
        You step closer to the first mirror. Your reflection's eyes seem sharper, more aware. You can almost feel the heightened senses it represents.
        
        *set curiosity +3
        *set perception +2
        
        "The Scout aspect," Aria says. "Those who can sense danger before it manifests, who read environments like texts."
        
        *goto role_reflection
    #Examine the magical mirror—action and spellwork
        The second mirror draws you in. Your reflection is surrounded by dancing lights, hands moving in complex patterns, magic responding to your will.
        
        *set magic_control +2
        *set academics +2

        *goto role_reflection
    #Approach the connecting mirror—empathy and bonds
        The third mirror shows something that makes your heart ache with recognition. Connection. Belonging. The threads between people made visible.
        
        *set empathy +3
        *set collaboration +3
        
        "The Heart aspect," Izack says softly. "Those who hold groups together when everything else falls apart."
        
        *goto role_reflection

*label role_reflection

*page_break

You spend several minutes in quiet contemplation, letting the mirrors show you different versions of yourself—potential versions, possible futures.

[i]"Heavy stuff, I know. But understanding your natural role makes everything else easier. Well, not easier. Less likely to end in disaster, let's say."[/i]

*line_break

When you step back, Aria produces three role cards from her pocket—they shimmer with the same colors as the mirrors.

"Choose," she says simply.

With your role selected, Aria guides you to the central equipment tables. The array is overwhelming—dozens of specialized tools, enchanted items, alchemical preparations, all carefully organized and labeled.

"You can't take everything," she says. "Choose one primary piece of equipment. It will shape how you approach challenges on your expedition."

*line_break

Izack runs his hand over the various items. "Each piece of gear is collaborative in nature—designed to work [i]with[/i] magic, not just channel it. Choose something that resonates with your role and your instincts."

*page_break

You survey your options:

The [b]Alchemical Satchel[/b] — A leather bag brimming with color-coded vials. Potions for healing, salves for enhancement, tinctures for perception. The Cassisi Lab's finest work.

The [b]Runethic Toolkit[/b] — Carving tools, rune stones, and chalk that never runs out. For those who write their magic rather than speak it.

The [b]Spirit Flute[/b] — A wooden instrument carved with flowing patterns. It attunes the player to plant and animal spirits, opening channels of communication.

The [b]Multi-Tool Drone[/b] — A Cassisivadan gadget that buzzes, chirps, and can repair equipment or scout ahead. Requires speaking Cassisivadan to operate fully.

*line_break

[i]"Choose wisely. This gear might save your life. Or at least make your inevitable panic more organized."[/i]

        You lift the satchel—it's heavier than expected, packed with carefully labeled vials. Each one glows softly with inner light.
        
        "Brewed by the Cassisi Lab," Izack says with obvious pride. "Aria's family has been perfecting these formulas for generations. They do wonders for headaches, vine burns, sand blindness, and frostbite."
        
        Aria hands you a small guidebook. "Read this. Mixing the wrong potions can have... interesting consequences."
        
        *page_break
        
        [i]"'Interesting consequences' is Aria-speak for 'you might accidentally turn your hair purple or make your teeth taste sounds.' Read. The. Manual."[/i]

        The toolkit unfolds like a magical toolbox—compartments within compartments, each holding precisely crafted instruments. The chalk feels alive in your hand, eager to write.
        
        "Remember: runes like straight lines and clear intent," Aria reminds you, her voice taking on a teacher's cadence. "Sloppy runes do sloppy magic. Respectful runes do collaborative magic."
        
        She demonstrates a simple protection rune on the table. It glows blue, then fades into the wood.
        
        *page_break

        The flute is warm to the touch, as if it's been sitting in sunlight. The wood grain swirls in patterns that seem to shift when you're not looking directly at them.
        
        Zara appears at your shoulder—you hadn't noticed her approach. "Oh, you chose the flute! That's wonderful." She demonstrates a simple melody, and for a moment, you swear you can hear the potted plants nearby humming in response.
        
        "It will help you hear what the Verdant Tithe is saying," she continues. "What the desert spirits whisper. What the glacier sings in frequencies humans usually can't perceive."

        The little device immediately springs to life when you touch it, unfolding from a compact sphere into a hovering mechanical companion. It chirps excitedly, circling your head like an enthusiastic hummingbird.
        
        "Ah, you picked Aria's personal favorite," Izack says with a grin.
        
        Aria actually looks pleased. "Cassisivadan engineering at its finest. The drone responds to voice commands, but only in Cassisivadan. I'll teach you the basics."
        
        For the next few minutes, she walks you through essential phrases: *zir'val* (scout ahead), *mend'kar* (repair), *val'syn* (return).

With your role and equipment chosen, you notice other students making their selections. Some work in pairs, discussing their choices. Others stand alone, looking overwhelmed.

A student you don't recognize well—a quiet person from the Boundary Weavers guild—stands frozen before the equipment table, hands trembling slightly.

        You walk over quietly. "First expedition?" you ask gently.
        
        The student nods, not meeting your eyes. "I can't decide. What if I choose wrong? What if I'm not ready?"
        
        You spend the next few minutes sharing your own nervousness, walking them through the options. By the end, they've selected a toolkit with a small, grateful smile.
        
        "Thank you," they whisper. "I'm Ven, by the way."
        
        *page_break
        
        Izack has been watching. He catches your eye and nods approvingly.

        The anxious student eventually makes a choice, though they still look uncertain.

The Preparation Hall begins to empty as evening approaches. Soft leyline light filters through the windows, painting everything in shades of amber and blue.

Aria has departed to check on glacier equipment logistics. Izack remains, speaking quietly with small groups of students about what to expect.

Polly shifts on your shoulder, her weight familiar and comforting.

"Gear and role are external," she says, her voice unusually serious. "But mindset? That's what actually determines how you'll handle what's coming. How are you approaching this expedition?"

        "Good," Polly says approvingly. "The expeditions respond to intentions. Go in expecting disaster, you'll probably find it. Go in expecting partnership... well, that usually works better."

        You mentally prepare to take notes on every plant, creature, magical resonance, and environmental phenomenon.
        
        "Just don't wander off chasing research," a voice warns. You turn to find Aria has returned. "Curiosity is valuable, but so is staying with your team."

        Izack materializes beside you, as if he has a sixth sense for student panic.
        
        "Everyone feels that way their first time," he says quietly, placing a reassuring hand on your shoulder. "Fear means you understand the stakes. That's actually a sign of wisdom."

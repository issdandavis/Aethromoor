After the initial greetings and orientation, a second-year student named Marcus leads you through the winding corridors of the residential tower.

[b]"All first-years get their own room,"[/b] he explains, gesturing at the numbered doors. [b]"Avalon grows them custom. Literally. The Academy is a living dimension, remember?"[/b]

*line_break

He stops in front of a door marked with your name—${name}—already inscribed in flowing script.

[b]"The room will shape itself to your preferences. Just... think about what you want, and the Academy will listen. It's actually pretty cool."[/b]

*page_break

You step inside.

The room is... empty. No, not empty—[i]potential[/i]. The walls shimmer with soft dimensional energy, waiting. There's a basic bed, a desk, and a window, but everything else is undefined, like a sketch waiting to be colored in.

*line_break

Polly hops off your shoulder and surveys the space critically.

[i]"Right. Your first major decision: interior design. How terrifyingly domestic."[/i]

*page_break

You reach out to touch the wall, and immediately feel the Academy's consciousness brush against yours. It's asking a question—not in words, but in feelings:

[i]What kind of space do you need?[/i]

*page_break

*choice
  #A cozy, comfortable sanctuary—warm colors, soft furniture, a space to relax and feel safe.
    *set room_style "cozy"
    *set dorm_style "sanctuary"
    *set dorm_comfort +20
    *set collaboration +5

    You think of warmth. Comfort. Home.

    The room [i]responds[/i].

    *page_break

    The walls shift to warm amber and deep burgundy. Soft rugs spread across the floor. The bed expands into a plush nest of pillows and blankets. A fireplace grows from the wall—not burning wood, but captured starlight that radiates gentle warmth.

    *line_break

    Polly settles onto a cushion that appeared specifically for her.

    [i]"Well. I approve. If I must narrate your story, at least I'll be comfortable doing it."[/i]

    *goto furniture_selection

  #A focused study space—clean lines, lots of natural light, organized shelves for research.
    *set room_style "scholarly"
    *set dorm_style "study"
    *set collaboration +5
    *set aria_relationship +5

    You think of clarity. Focus. Knowledge.

    The room [i]transforms[/i].

    *page_break

    The walls become a soft cream color. The window expands, flooding the space with natural light. Bookshelves grow from the walls in elegant spirals. The desk multiplies into a proper research station with multiple surfaces.

    *line_break

    A small library ladder appears, providing access to the higher shelves.

    Polly perches on a reading stand.

    [i]"A scholar's retreat. Aria would approve. Though I hope you actually plan to use all these shelves."[/i]

    *goto furniture_selection

  #A magical workshop—space for experiments, unusual storage, organized chaos.
    *set room_style "experimental"
    *set dorm_style "workshop"
    *set dorm_magical +20
    *set izack_relationship +5

    You think of possibility. Experimentation. Creative chaos.

    The room [i]erupts[/i] with potential.

    *page_break

    The walls become a shifting color—blue, then purple, then silver, cycling through hues. Workbenches grow from the floor. Cabinets with dozens of small drawers appear, each labeled in glowing script. The ceiling opens up, revealing a miniature dimensional pocket for dangerous experiments.

    *line_break

    A crystal sphere materializes in the corner, constantly swirling with captured dimensional energy.

    Polly eyes it warily.

    [i]"Please tell me you're not going to blow up your own room within the first week."[/i]

    *goto furniture_selection

  #A minimalist space—simple, clean, meditative. Less clutter, more room to think.
    *set room_style "minimal"
    *set dorm_style "zen"
    *set collaboration +10

    You think of simplicity. Space. Breathing room.

    The room [i]clarifies[/i].

    *page_break

    The walls become a soft gray-blue. The furniture reduces to essentials—a simple bed, a single elegant desk, one perfect chair. The window becomes a floor-to-ceiling view of the sky. The floor is smooth pale wood.

    *line_break

    There's something peaceful about the emptiness. Room to think. Room to be.

    Polly lands on the windowsill.

    [i]"Zen monastery aesthetic. I can work with this. Though I warn you—I'm likely to clutter it within days."[/i]

    *goto furniture_selection

*label furniture_selection

*page_break

The room has taken its basic shape, but the Academy is still listening.

You feel it asking: [i]What else do you need?[/i]

*line_break

Marcus pokes his head in, clearly impressed.

[b]"Whoa. Nice choice. You can add features too—Avalon's pretty generous with first-year accommodations. Pick something useful."[/b]

*page_break

*choice
  #A familiar perch—a special roost near the window for Polly (or future familiars).
    *set has_familiar_perch true
    *set polly_relationship +10
    *set dorm_comfort +5

    You gesture toward the window.

    "Can we have a perch? For Polly?"

    *line_break

    The Academy responds immediately.

    A beautiful perch grows from the windowsill—carved from what looks like crystallized starlight, perfectly sized for a raven. It even has a small cushion.

    *page_break

    Polly flies over and settles onto it, fluffing her feathers with obvious pleasure.

    [i]"Oh. Oh, this is [b]nice[/b]. You may have just earned points, ${name}. I have my own throne."[/i]

    *line_break

    She preens, clearly delighted.

    [i]"I take back half the sarcastic things I was planning to say about you this week. Half."[/i]

    *goto magical_addition

  #A study nook—a cozy reading corner with perfect lighting and a comfortable chair.
    *set has_study_nook true
    *set dorm_comfort +10
    *set aria_relationship +5

    You point to a corner.

    "A reading nook? Somewhere quiet to study?"

    *line_break

    The Academy shapes the space.

    An alcove grows from the wall, just large enough for a perfect armchair. The lighting adjusts automatically—soft for relaxation, bright for reading. A small side table appears, perfectly positioned for tea or books.

    *page_break

    Marcus nods approvingly.

    [b]"Smart. You'll spend a lot of late nights studying. That's going to save your back."[/b]

    *line_break

    Polly examines the nook.

    [i]"Practical. I can perch on the chair back and offer unsolicited commentary on your reading material."[/i]

    *goto magical_addition

  #An alchemy corner—proper ventilation, heat-resistant surfaces, ingredient storage.
    *set has_alchemy_corner true
    *set dorm_magical +15
    *set zara_relationship +5

    You look at the wall.

    "Could I have a small workspace? For potions and alchemy?"

    *line_break

    The Academy creates something remarkable.

    A corner of the room transforms into a miniature alchemist's lab—small but perfectly organized. A heat-proof workbench appears with built-in burners. Ventilation opens to an external dimension. Rows of small vials and jars materialize, empty but ready.

    *page_break

    Marcus whistles.

    [b]"Whoa. Advanced choice. You planning to study with Zara?"[/b]

    *line_break

    Polly eyes the setup nervously.

    [i]"Please be careful with that. I've seen what happens when alchemy goes wrong. It's messy. And occasionally explosive."[/i]

    *goto magical_addition

  #A meditation space—clear floor area, calming atmospheric magic, peaceful energy.
    *set dorm_comfort +10
    *set dorm_magical +5
    *set collaboration +10

    You gesture to an open area.

    "A space for meditation? Practicing dimensional awareness?"

    *line_break

    The Academy understands.

    A section of floor becomes subtly different—still the same material, but somehow more [i]present[/i]. The dimensional energy in that space clarifies, making it easier to sense magical currents. Soft ambient light emanates from nowhere in particular.

    *page_break

    Marcus looks impressed.

    [b]"That's... actually really smart. Practicing dimensional sense in a controlled environment. Izack will love that."[/b]

    *line_break

    Polly tilts her head.

    [i]"The wise choice. Though I'll try not to interrupt when you're being all zen and mystical."[/i]

    [i]She pauses.[/i]

    [i]"I'll [b]try[/b]. No promises."[/i]

    *goto magical_addition

*label magical_addition

*page_break

Marcus checks a small notebook.

[b]"Okay, last thing. Every room gets one magical feature—something unique from the Academy itself. What sounds interesting?"[/b]

*page_break

*choice
  #A window that shows different realms—toggle between views of Avalon's pocket dimensions.
    *set window_view "multi_realm"
    *set dorm_magical +15
    *set izack_relationship +5

    "Can the window show different places? Like, different realms?"

    *line_break

    The window [i]shifts[/i].

    *page_break

    Suddenly you're not looking at the courtyard anymore. You're looking at the Singing Dunes—golden sand stretching to the horizon under three moons.

    *line_break

    You blink, and the view changes to the Verdant Tithe—massive trees swaying in the wind.

    Another blink: the Rune Glacier, ice glittering with embedded runes.

    *page_break

    Marcus grins.

    [b]"Multi-realm window. Fancy. You can control it mentally—just think about where you want to look."[/b]

    *line_break

    You focus on "courtyard," and the window shifts back to the normal view.

    Polly approves.

    [i]"Excellent. Now I can people-watch across multiple dimensions. My favorite hobby."[/i]

    *goto room_complete

  #A dimensional clock that tracks time differently—helpful for sensing temporal shifts.
    *set magical_feature "time_clock"
    *set dorm_magical +10
    *set aria_relationship +5

    "Something to help track time? Dimensional time is confusing..."

    *line_break

    A clock appears on the wall.

    *page_break

    But it's not a normal clock.

    It has multiple faces, each showing time in a different pocket dimension. Avalon Standard Time. Earth Time. Leyline Resonance. Dimensional Flow Rate.

    *line_break

    Marcus nods.

    [b]"Temporal awareness clock. Really useful. You'll learn to read it in Aria's class. Helps you sense when dimensional time is being weird."[/b]

    *page_break

    Polly studies it.

    [i]"Practical. Though I've been alive long enough that I've stopped caring what time it is. Time is a social construct anyway."[/i]

    *goto room_complete

  #A growth garden—a small dimensional pocket where plants grow impossibly fast.
    *set magical_feature "garden_pocket"
    *set dorm_magical +15
    *set zara_relationship +10

    "Could I have a small garden? For growing magical plants?"

    *line_break

    The Academy creates something beautiful.

    *page_break

    A section of wall becomes transparent, revealing a pocket dimension beyond—a small garden space where plants grow in accelerated time. You could plant something in the morning and harvest it by evening.

    *line_break

    Marcus's eyes widen.

    [b]"Whoa. A growth pocket. That's an advanced request. Zara's going to love you."[/b]

    *page_break

    You can see herbs and flowers already starting to grow inside—the Academy must have seeded it.

    Polly peers at it.

    [i]"Don't grow anything poisonous. Or carnivorous. I've seen what happens when students get ambitious with magical plants."[/i]

    *goto room_complete

  #A memory crystal—records moments you want to remember, plays them back as holograms.
    *set magical_feature "memory_crystal"
    *set dorm_magical +10
    *set dorm_comfort +10

    "Something to help remember important moments?"

    *line_break

    A crystal grows from your desk—palm-sized, multifaceted, glowing softly.

    *page_break

    Marcus picks it up carefully and hands it to you.

    [b]"Memory crystal. Touch it when you want to record a moment—it'll capture everything. Visual, audio, even emotional context. Touch it again later to replay. Really personal."[/b]

    *line_break

    You hold it, and it warms to your touch, responding to your magical signature.

    *page_break

    Polly eyes it thoughtfully.

    [i]"That's... actually sweet. Though fair warning—I'm in most of your memories, so prepare for a lot of sarcastic commentary when you replay them."[/i]

    *goto room_complete

*label room_complete

*page_break

The room settles.

What was potential and possibility has become [i]yours[/i]. This space knows you now. The Academy shaped it to fit who you are, or who you're becoming.

*line_break

Marcus heads toward the door.

[b]"All set! Classes start tomorrow. Get some rest—you'll need it."[/b]

*page_break

He leaves, and you're alone in your new room.

*if room_style = "cozy"
  You sink into the soft cushions, feeling the warmth of the dimensional fireplace.

*if room_style = "scholarly"
  You run your hand along the bookshelves, already imagining them filled with texts.

*if room_style = "experimental"
  You examine the workbenches, your mind already racing with possibilities.

*if room_style = "minimal"
  You stand in the center of the open space, breathing in the simplicity.

*line_break

Polly settles into her spot and regards you with one bright eye.

*page_break

[i]"So,"[/i] she says. [i]"This is your home now. In a living, sentient pocket dimension created by the greatest dimensional mage in history. No pressure."[/i]

*line_break

You look around at what the Academy created for you.

*if has_familiar_perch
  Polly's perch gleams in the light.

*if has_study_nook
  The reading nook looks inviting and comfortable.

*if has_alchemy_corner
  The alchemy corner waits, ready for experiments.

*if window_view = "multi_realm"
  The multi-realm window shows the Singing Dunes in the distance.

*line_break

It feels right. It feels like [i]yours[/i].

*page_break

[i]"Get some sleep,"[/i] Polly advises. [i]"Tomorrow, your real education begins."[/i]

*line_break

You settle into bed.

The room dims automatically, responding to your tiredness. Through the window, you can see the Spiral Spire gleaming against the night sky, and the World Tree's branches swaying in a breeze that carries magic itself.

*page_break

You're here. You're home.

And tomorrow, everything changes.

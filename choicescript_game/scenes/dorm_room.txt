*label dorm_room
The corridors of the student dorms twist in spirals lined with runes and charm-lights. The walls themselves hum softly as if sharing secrets among themselves.  

You find your assigned door — a wood panel carved with your initials and a faint shimmer of protective spells.  
Inside is an empty room waiting to be made yours. Floating crates hold sheets, blankets, and a variety of decorations waiting for you to pick from.  

Polly perches on a shelf. "First lesson of Avalon dorm life," she says. "Make your space suit *you*, not what you think you should be. Reality will adjust."

How do you set up your room?

*choice
    #Make it cozy and inviting: pillows, rugs, and plant charms.
        *set room_style "cozy"
        *set base_comfort 75
        *set stress -5
        *set empathy +3
        Your room becomes a nest of warm colors and gentle textures. Tiny luminescent vines twine around the bedposts, and a faint herbal scent fills the air.
        Polly nods. "Your nesting instinct is strong. With any luck, it will keep stress at bay when exams roll around."
        *goto roommate_intro
    #Fill it with books, maps, and runic diagrams.
        *set room_style "scholarly"
        *set base_knowledge_gain 1.2
        *set academics +5
        *set relationship_aria +3
        You arrange your shelves by subject and era. A central table is soon covered in scribbled notes and open codices. The air vibrates with intellectual promise.
        Aria pokes her head in at some point and offers you a rare scroll. "I've been meaning to give this to someone who will appreciate it," she says.
        *goto roommate_intro
    #Turn it into a miniature workshop: prototypes, enchanted gadgets, and experiment tables.
        *set room_style "experimental"
        *set magical_accident_chance 0.15
        *set creativity +5
        *set relationship_izack +3
        Tools and scraps fill your desk, and a variety of half-built devices hum gently. Spells inscribed on the walls adjust to your tinkering frequency.
        Izack stops by and grins. "Ah, a fellow inventor," he says. "Just remember to file the proper safety runes."
        *goto roommate_intro
    #Leave it mostly empty, a blank canvas that adapts to your mood.
        *set room_style "adaptive"
        *set flexibility +5
        *set stress -2
        The room remains airy and uncluttered. You hang a single tapestry that shifts colors with your emotions, and everything else rearranges itself as needed.
        Polly caws softly. "I see your desire for change reflected here. Just don't misplace your shoes between dimensions."
        *goto roommate_intro

*label roommate_intro
*comment Introduce a random roommate or allow the player to choose.
*temp roommate ""
*rand roommate_choice 1 3

*if (roommate_choice = 1)
    *set roommate "Nora"
    *set roommate_description "a Timeweaver student who meticulously labels everything and has a clock collection that hums in sync with the leylines."
*elseif (roommate_choice = 2)
    *set roommate "Jax"
    *set roommate_description "a Diplomancer with a talent for playing the lute and charming even the grumpiest spellbooks."
*else
    *set roommate "Mina"
    *set roommate_description "an Elementalist who keeps a small thundercloud in a jar and doodles storm patterns when bored."

*comment Present the roommate.
As you put the finishing touches on your space, there is a soft knock at the door.  
Standing there is ${roommate}, ${roommate_description}
.

"Oh! You must be ${name}," ${roommate} says. "I heard we were assigned together. Mind if I come in?"

*choice
    #Invite them warmly and offer to help unpack.
        *set social +3
        *set empathy +2
        ${roommate} beams. "Thanks! It's nice to meet someone friendly right away."  
        You spend the next hour chatting about classes and hometowns while unpacking.  
        Polly watches from the shelf, occasionally adding unhelpful commentary.
        *goto roommate_bond
    #Smile politely and return to your own tasks.
        *set social +1
        *set individual_power +2
        ${roommate} takes the hint and quietly sets up their side of the room.  
        The silence isn't uncomfortable, just companionable.  
        Polly winks at you. "You two will figure out your rhythm," she says.
        *goto roommate_bond
    #Close the door gently and ask for some space to finish settling in.
        *set stress -2
        *set independence +3
        ${roommate} nods understandingly. "No problem," they say. "I'll come back later to introduce myself properly."
        Polly raises an eyebrow but doesn't comment.  
        *goto roommate_bond

*label roommate_bond
*comment Strengthen or weaken the bond with the roommate.
${roommate} eventually returns with a plate of pastries from the cafeteria.

*choice
    #Accept and share stories about your first day.
        *set social +2
        *set empathy +2
        *set collaboration +2
        The two of you swap tales of guild ceremonies and hidden staircases.  
        ${roommate} becomes more animated when talking about their chosen focus.  
        A comfortable friendship forms.
        *goto dorm_closing
    #Politely decline and suggest they enjoy them.
        *set individual_power +1
        *set independence +2
        ${roommate} shrugs and starts eating while reading a spell tome.  
        Polly whispers, "Introverts unite separately in your own rooms."  
        *goto dorm_closing
    #Share the pastries with Polly and laugh about living with a magical raven.
        *set polly_relationship +3
        *set joy +2
        Polly hops down and selects the flakiest pastry.  
        "Finally, a perk to this 'familiar' gig," she says. You all laugh, even if the pastries vanish quickly.  
        ${roommate} seems bemused but entertained.  
        *goto dorm_closing

*label dorm_closing
As evening settles, you feel your room adjusting around you, resonating with your choices.  
The spiral outside glows gently; students' lights flicker like fireflies across the campus.  
Polly fluffs her feathers and nods approvingly at your space. "Good work, ${name}," she says. "The Spiralverse will shape you, but you shape it right back."

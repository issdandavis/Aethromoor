  You already have ${golem_name} as your golem companion.
  *goto_scene academy_life

*page_break

During a free afternoon, you discover a workshop beneath the Academy—Grey's domain.

Grey is a massive golem commander, built of stone and bronze, with eyes that glow with ancient intelligence.

*page_break

[b]"A student,"[/b] Grey rumbles. [b]"Come to learn golem-craft, have you?"[/b]

${He_She} gestures to workbenches covered with clay, crystals, and arcane tools.

[b]"I can teach you to create a golem companion. Not a servant—a partner. Like Clayborn."[/b]

*page_break

A smaller golem appears—Clayborn, made of living clay that shifts and morphs. When music plays nearby, Clayborn dances.

*choice
  #"Yes, I want to create a golem companion."
    *goto golem_creation

  #"Maybe later. I'm not ready yet."
    *goto_scene academy_life

*label golem_creation

Grey nods.

[b]"First: choose your golem's element. This defines their nature."[/b]

*choice
  #Earth - Sturdy, loyal, protective
    *set golem_element "earth"
    *goto golem_personality_choice

  #Fire - Passionate, energetic, fierce
    *set golem_element "fire"
    *goto golem_personality_choice

  #Water - Adaptive, flowing, empathetic
    *set golem_element "water"
    *goto golem_personality_choice

  #Air - Swift, curious, clever
    *set golem_element "air"
    *goto golem_personality_choice

  #Crystal - Precise, magical, attuned to leylines
    *set golem_element "crystal"
    *goto golem_personality_choice

*label golem_personality_choice

*page_break

Grey hands you clay infused with ${golem_element} essence.

[b]"Now shape it. As you work, think about who your golem will be. Their personality will form from your intentions."[/b]

*page_break

What kind of personality do you envision?

*choice
  #Protective guardian - loyal and brave
    *set golem_personality "guardian"
    *goto golem_naming

  #Curious scholar - seeking knowledge
    *set golem_personality "scholar"
    *goto golem_naming

  #Playful companion - joyful and mischievous
    *set golem_personality "playful"
    *goto golem_naming

  #Silent watcher - observant and calm
    *set golem_personality "watcher"
    *goto golem_naming

*label golem_naming

*page_break

What will you name your golem?

*input_text golem_name

*page_break

You shape the clay, infusing it with ${golem_element} essence and your intentions.

The golem begins to form—at first just a rough shape, then details emerge. Eyes that glow with inner light. Limbs that move with purpose.

*page_break

Grey places a hand on your creation.

[b]"The final step: awakening. Give ${golem_name} a piece of yourself—a memory, an emotion, a truth. This makes them truly alive."[/b]

*choice
  #Share a happy memory
    *set golem_personality "${golem_personality}_joyful"
    *set empathy +10
    You think of your happiest moment and pour it into ${golem_name}.

  #Share your determination to learn
    *set golem_personality "${golem_personality}_determined"
    *set knowledge +10
    You think of your drive to master magic and pour it into ${golem_name}.

  #Share your hope for the future
    *set golem_personality "${golem_personality}_hopeful"
    *set collaboration +10
    You think of the future you want to build and pour it into ${golem_name}.

*page_break

${golem_name}'s eyes flare with light.

The golem stands, looks at you, and—

*if golem_personality = "playful"
  —immediately starts dancing like Clayborn.

*if golem_personality = "guardian"
  —moves to stand protectively beside you.

*if golem_personality = "scholar"
  —reaches for a nearby book with curious intent.

*if golem_personality = "watcher"
  —simply observes everything with calm, glowing eyes.

*page_break

Grey nods with satisfaction.

[b]"Well done. ${golem_name} is alive, aware, and bonded to you. Treat ${him_her} well."[/b]

*set has_golem true
*set grey_relationship +20
*set power +10
*set individual_vs_collective +10

*page_break

*if polly_is_familiar
  Polly eyes ${golem_name} critically.

  [i]"Great. Now you have two companions. This is going to get crowded."[/i]

  *page_break

You now have ${golem_name}, your ${golem_element} golem companion.

Together with ${familiar_name}, you're building quite the magical entourage.

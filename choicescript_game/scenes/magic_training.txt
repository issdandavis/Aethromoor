  You've learned to create small, temporary portals—no larger than your hand, lasting only a few minutes, but perfect for reaching objects across short distances.

  Izack grins. "Your first portal! Congratulations, ${name}."

  You've learned to create a small pocket dimension—a space between spaces where you can store objects safely. It's no bigger than a backpack, but it's [i]yours[/i].

  Izack watches as you carve out the pocket space with careful dimensional manipulation. "Personal storage dimensions are a rite of passage for dimensional mages."

You try to visualize the boundary, but your mental image keeps shifting. Is it a shell? A field? A wall? The uncertainty shows in your casting.

The ward forms—sort of. It's flickering, unstable, with visible weak points. When you test it with a gentle push, it collapses entirely.

Aria's expression is unreadable. "Your foundation is unclear. You're trying to build without knowing what you're building."

  You've mastered the basic protective ward—a translucent barrier that can deflect physical objects and minor magical effects. It's the foundation of all boundary magic.

  *line_break

  Aria actually nods in approval. "Every boundary mage's first spell. Use it well."

*if spell_unlocked = "Elemental Barrier"
  You've learned to create specialized barriers that specifically block elemental attacks—fire, ice, lightning, or force. The ward recognizes the nature of incoming threats and adapts.

  *line_break

  When you demonstrate by blocking one of Aria's test fire bolts, she allows herself a small smile. "Efficient."

*if spell_unlocked = "Selective Permeability"
  You've learned the art of creating boundaries that allow some things through while blocking others. You can make a barrier that stops weapons but permits people, or blocks magic but allows physical touch.

  *line_break

  Aria observes your demonstration with interest. "This technique separates competent boundary mages from masters."

*if spell_unlocked = "Dimensional Seal"
  You've learned to seal dimensional rifts and prevent portal formation in designated areas. This is powerful magic, capable of cutting off entire dimensions from each other.

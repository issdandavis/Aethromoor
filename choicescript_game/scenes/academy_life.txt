    The first days at Avalon blur together in a spiral of lectures, lunch at floating platforms, and late-night study sessions illuminated by bioluminescent orbs.  
    Your energy waxes and wanes, your relationships grow, and your understanding of the Spiral deepens.  
    Soon, you'll face larger challenges: your first expedition, your thesis selection, perhaps even a romance.

"All students to their morning modules," Aria calls as the first bell of the day reverberates through the Spire.

        Izack paces excitedly before a chalkboard filled with spirals, equations, and doodles of you tripping over your own feet.  
        "Dimensional resonance isn't just math," he says. "It's a song you have to feel. Now, everyone: hum along."

        In the middle of the lecture, he stops and frowns at a diagram. "Hmm. That shouldn't be there." He promptly erases the entire board.  
        "We'll revisit that when the chalk stops arguing with me," he says.

        *set aria_relationship +2
        In a chamber lined with shifting stone rings, Aria demonstrates how to thread spells through boundaries without tearing them.  
        "Gentle pressure, like coaxing a cat out from under a couch," she explains.  
        You manage to weave a small portal that doesn't collapse. For a moment, you glimpse a sunlit beach on the other side before Aria closes it.

        Zara sits cross-legged in a grove of potted trees and explains how to listen to plant spirits.  
        "You can't force a tree to grow faster," she says. "You can only create conditions for growth and negotiate."  
        A vine climbs up your arm and curls affectionately around your wrist.

        *set aria_relationship +1
        For one class, you watch Izack and Aria work together on a complex negotiation with reality: coaxing a stubborn staircase into aligning with the library.  
        The process is messy, brilliant, and involves a lot of muttered Runethic from Aria and enthusiastic Kor'aelin from Izack.  
        You learn more from their interplay than from any lecture.

        You settle at a table that occasionally drifts between shelves like a gentle gondola.  
        During your session, a book about ancient Nexus rituals falls open to a page describing the Aethyrion Invocation. The Kor'aelin script glimmers faintly.

                As you mouth the Kor'aelin words, the air chills and mint fills your nose.  
                A passing Lorekeeper raises an eyebrow. "Careful," she says, "the library doesn't appreciate uninvited summoning."

                The runes leave shimmering afterimages on your parchment, making you suspect they may rearrange themselves later.

        The Leyline Gazebo thrums with raw potential. You focus your will and try to weave a stable sphere of force.

            #Command the magic to hold.

                The sphere flares bright before collapsing. Your energy spikes and a strand of hair stands on end.  
                You feel exhilarated but also scorched.

                You whisper, *sil'ra kor'gal* — "flow-heart strength". The sphere forms gently and hums in your hands, stable and warm.

        You sit beneath a holographic projection of the World Tree. Its roots feel solid beneath you, its leaves shimmering with all possible colors.  
        For a moment, you feel time slow down and your thoughts align with the Spiral.

        Polly shudders. "Rule-breaking already? I like your style."  
        You sneak through an unlit corridor and discover a hidden staircase that descends into the belly of the Spire. Do you go?

                The stairs lead to an underground chamber filled with luminous mushrooms and old runes. You sense a latent magic here.  
                You find a small Runethic plaque carved with the words *Vel'ar nos med'ar thular syn'ar nuu*, the Runethic version of the Aethyrion Invocation, and feel your connection to the Spiral deepen.

[b]== TWO WEEKS LATER ==[/b]

*line_break

You've settled into the rhythm of Avalon Academy.

*page_break

Mornings are dimensional theory with Aria Ravencrest. She's brilliant, demanding, and doesn't tolerate sloppy thinking. You've learned more in two weeks than you thought possible.

Afternoons are practical magic with Izack Thorne. He's patient, enthusiastic, and genuinely delighted when students have breakthroughs.

Evenings are collaborative exercises with Zara, who somehow makes grueling magical workouts feel like friendly conversations.

*page_break

*if dorm_style = "sanctuary"
  Every night, you return to your cozy room and collapse into the soft cushions, exhausted but satisfied.

*if dorm_style = "study"
  Every night, you return to your study and spend hours poring over texts, building your understanding.

*if dorm_style = "workshop"
  Every night, you return to your workshop and experiment with what you learned, testing limits.

*if dorm_style = "zen"
  Every night, you return to your minimalist space and meditate, integrating the day's lessons.

Polly watches your progress with sarcastic running commentary.

*page_break

[i]"You're improving,"[/i] she admits one evening. [i]"Not bad for someone who arrived two weeks ago looking like a lost duckling."[/i]

*line_break

You're learning. Growing. But today is different.

Today, Izack announced something important:

[b]"It's time for specialized training. Choose your focus carefully—this will shape your approach to magic for years to come."[/b]

*page_break

*label class_selection

You stand in the Hall of Threads, where the three master mages wait.

Each of them offers a different path of study for the next month before your first expedition.

*page_break

[b]Aria Ravencrest[/b] stands by shelves of ancient texts.

[b]"Theoretical dimensional magic,"[/b] she says. [b]"Understanding the [i]why[/i] behind the [i]how[/i]. Perfect for those who seek knowledge."[/b]

*line_break

[b]Izack Thorne[/b] gestures to a practice space filled with shimmering boundaries.

[b]"Practical application,"[/b] he explains. [b]"Learning by doing, by feeling, by collaborating with magic itself."[/b]

*line_break

[b]Zara[/b] indicates a door leading to the gardens.

[b]"Living magic,"[/b] she says softly. [b]"Working with nature, alchemy, the intersection of life and dimensional power."[/b]

  #Study theory with Aria—understand the fundamental principles of dimensional magic.
    *set class_focus "theory"
    *set aria_relationship +15
    *set collaboration +5

    You approach Aria.

    "I want to understand the theory. The foundations."

    *line_break

    She nods, something like approval in her eyes.

    [b]"Good. Too many students rush to practice before understanding principles. Come."[/b]

    *page_break

    The next month is intense.

    Aria teaches you the mathematics of dimensional boundaries, the physics of pocket realities, the philosophy of collaborative magic versus individual power.

    *line_break

    You learn why Izack's Avalon works—not just [i]that[/i] it works, but the theoretical framework that makes a living, growing dimension possible.

    *page_break

    One evening, Aria looks up from a particularly complex diagram.

    [b]"You have a good mind for this,"[/b] she says quietly. [b]"Many students can [i]do[/i] magic. Few truly [i]understand[/i] it."[/b]

    *line_break

    It's the closest thing to praise you've heard from her.

  #Practice application with Izack—learn by doing, by feeling magic directly.
    *set class_focus "practical"
    *set izack_relationship +15
    *set collaboration +10

    You approach Izack.

    "I want to practice. To feel how magic actually works."

    *line_break

    His face lights up.

    [b]"Perfect! Theory is important, but there's nothing like [i]experiencing[/i] magic directly. Let's begin."[/b]

    *page_break

    The next month is exhilarating.

    Izack teaches you by demonstration. You create your first pocket dimension—tiny, unstable, but [i]yours[/i]. You learn to sense dimensional boundaries by touch, by instinct, by collaboration.

    *line_break

    You make mistakes. Lots of them. But Izack treats each failure as a learning opportunity.

    *page_break

    One afternoon, you successfully stabilize a dimensional thread without conscious effort—pure instinct.

    Izack grins.

    [b]"That's it! You felt it, didn't you? The magic [i]wants[/i] to work with you. You just have to listen."[/b]

    *line_break

    You're not just learning magic. You're learning to [i]partner[/i] with it.

    *set collaboration +10
    *goto training_partner_selection

  #Work with living magic with Zara—explore the intersection of life and dimensional power.
    *set class_focus "living_magic"
    *set zara_relationship +15
    *set collaboration +10

    You approach Zara.

    "I want to work with living magic. Nature and dimensional power together."

    *line_break

    She smiles warmly.

    [b]"Wonderful. Most students forget that magic isn't separate from life—it [i]is[/i] life, in another form. Come, I'll show you."[/b]

    *page_break

    The next month is transformative.

    Zara teaches you to sense the life force in plants, to feel how dimensional energy and biological energy interweave. You learn alchemy not as mixing ingredients, but as [i]conversing[/i] with living things.

    *line_break

    You grow your first magical plant—a small Thoughtvine cutting that responds to your emotions.

    *page_break

    *if magical_feature = "garden_pocket"
      You plant it in your room's growth pocket, and watch it thrive in the accelerated time.

      Zara is delighted.

      [b]"You have the gift for this. Your garden pocket is already flourishing."[/b]

    *if magical_feature != "garden_pocket"
      You keep it in a pot on your windowsill, tending it carefully.

      Zara checks on it regularly, pleased with your care.

      [b]"You're a natural at this. The plant trusts you already."[/b]

    *line_break

    You're learning that power isn't just about control—it's about relationship.

    *set collaboration +10
    *goto training_partner_selection

*label training_partner_selection

*page_break

Beyond formal classes, students are encouraged to practice together.

Collaborative magic requires partners, and you've been assigned to small study groups for evening practice sessions.

*page_break

Tonight's session focuses on paired dimensional sensing—two mages working together to detect and map boundary threads.

You can choose your practice partner:

*page_break

  #Partner with Lyra, a quiet student who excels at precision work.
    *set training_partner "lyra"
    *set collaboration +10

    You approach Lyra, who's already setting up the practice space with meticulous care.

    "Want to partner up?"

    *line_break

    She nods, adjusting her glasses.

    [b]"Sure. I work best with people who take this seriously."[/b]

    *page_break

    You spend the next hour mapping dimensional threads together.

    Lyra is incredibly precise—she catches details you miss, and you provide the broader pattern recognition she sometimes overlooks.

    *line_break

    It's... satisfying. Working with someone whose skills complement your own.

    *page_break

    When you successfully map a particularly complex boundary together, Lyra actually smiles.

    [b]"Good work. We should practice together more often."[/b]

    *line_break

    *if class_focus = "theory"
      [b]"You understand the theory well. That helps."[/b]

    *if class_focus = "practical"
      [b]"Your instincts are strong. That compensates for my overthinking."[/b]

    *if class_focus = "living_magic"
      [b]"You sense things differently than I do. It's useful."[/b]

    *goto evening_reflection

  #Partner with Kade, an enthusiastic student who sometimes bites off more than he can chew.
    *set training_partner "kade"
    *set collaboration +15

    You approach Kade, who's bouncing with energy.

    "Partners?"

    *line_break

    He grins.

    [b]"Absolutely! Let's try something ambitious!"[/b]

    *page_break

    Kade's enthusiasm is infectious but sometimes overwhelming.

    He suggests mapping a dimensional cascade—a complex, multi-layered boundary that's well above first-year level.

    *line_break

    You try it anyway.

    *page_break

    It's... chaotic. You catch Kade when his magical reach exceeds his grasp. He pushes you to attempt things you wouldn't try alone.

    You don't succeed at mapping the cascade, but you learn more from the attempt than you would have from a safe exercise.

    *line_break

    Kade laughs when you both collapse, magically exhausted.

    [b]"Okay, that was too much. But wasn't it fun?"[/b]

    *page_break

    You have to admit—it was.

    *if class_focus = "theory"
      [b]"Your theory knowledge saved us from completely failing,"[/b] Kade says. [b]"Without you explaining what was happening, I'd have been lost."[/b]

    *if class_focus = "practical"
      [b]"Your instincts are sharp,"[/b] Kade says. [b]"You knew when to pull back before we hurt ourselves."[/b]

    *if class_focus = "living_magic"
      [b]"You work with magic so naturally,"[/b] Kade says. [b]"It's like you're having a conversation with it."[/b]

    *goto evening_reflection

  #Partner with Selene, a talented but competitive student who's always trying to prove herself.
    *set training_partner "selene"
    *set collaboration +5

    You approach Selene, who's practicing alone with intense focus.

    "Want to work together?"

    *line_break

    She eyes you critically.

    [b]"Fine. But I'm not slowing down for anyone."[/b]

    *page_break

    Working with Selene is... challenging.

    She's genuinely talented, but she treats every exercise like a competition. When you're supposed to be collaborating, she's trying to do it faster, better, more impressively.

    *line_break

    It's frustrating. But it also pushes you.

    *page_break

    By the end of the session, you've both mapped more boundaries than anyone else in the class.

    Selene looks satisfied.

    [b]"Not bad. You kept up."[/b]

    *line_break

    It's not exactly praise, but coming from her, it might be the closest thing.

    *page_break

    *if class_focus = "theory"
      [b]"Your theoretical knowledge is solid,"[/b] she admits grudgingly. [b]"Even if your practical application could use work."[/b]

    *if class_focus = "practical"
      [b]"You have good instincts,"[/b] she says. [b]"Raw, but good."[/b]

    *if class_focus = "living_magic"
      [b]"Interesting approach,"[/b] she says. [b]"Unconventional, but effective."[/b]

Later that night, you return to your dorm room.

*if has_familiar_perch
  Polly is waiting on her perch, preening her feathers.

*if dorm_style = "sanctuary"
  Polly is nested in the cushions by the dimensional fireplace.

*if dorm_style = "study"
  Polly is perched on one of your bookshelves, examining your notes.

*if dorm_style = "workshop"
  Polly is carefully avoiding the alchemy corner while eyeing your experiments suspiciously.

*page_break

[i]"Productive day?"[/i] she asks.

*line_break

You collapse into a chair and tell her about the training.

*if training_partner = "lyra"
  [i]"Ah, Lyra. Precise, methodical, slightly obsessive. You two will either work perfectly together or drive each other mad. Could go either way."[/i]

*if training_partner = "kade"
  [i]"Kade. Enthusiastic, overambitious, terrible at knowing his limits. He'll either help you grow or get you both in trouble. Possibly both."[/i]

*if training_partner = "selene"
  [i]"Selene. Competitive, talented, desperate to prove something. She'll push you to improve, but don't expect warmth. Competition isn't the same as collaboration, but sometimes it helps anyway."[/i]

*page_break

She tilts her head, studying you.

[i]"You're learning more than just magic here, ${name}. You're learning who you are as a mage. Who you are as a person."[/i]

[i]"The expedition is coming soon. Your first real test. But I think... I think you might be ready."[/i]

*page_break

*if window_view = "multi_realm"
  You look out your multi-realm window, shifting the view to the Singing Dunes.

*if window_view = "courtyard"
  You look out your window at the Spiral Spire gleaming in the moonlight.

Ready or not, the expedition is only days away.

*comment Scene representing the Verdant Tithe expedition. Contains multiple trials.

*label verdant_tithe
*comment This scene is called when the player enters the Verdant Tithe.  

The Verdant Tithe greets you like the breath of a living world. Towering trees arch overhead, their leaves shimmering with faint magical currents.  
Vines coil and uncoil like curious serpents, and the ground itself pulses faintly, as if beneath its soil beats a giant heart.  

"Remember," Zara whispers, "we are guests here."  
Izack nods. "And the Tithe has a sense of humor."  
Polly caws. "Brace yourselves."

You emerge from the Verdant Tithe into a clearing where shafts of sunlight pierce the canopy.  
Everyone breathes easier. You feel changed, not just by what you saw but by how you faced it.  
Izack clasps your shoulder. "You did well," he says. "The Tithe doesn't yield easily, but you navigated it without losing yourself."  
Aria smiles softly. "Rest. We'll debrief in the morning."  
Polly lands on your head. "And maybe shower. You have moss in your hair."

*comment Labyrinth of Roots
*label laby_roots
Massive roots twist and loop like serpents, forming a maze that shifts as you watch.  
You step onto the first path and the roots close behind you.  
Polly perches overhead, flying just above the ever-changing labyrinth.

*choice
    #Use your Scout instincts to look for patterns in the shifting roots.
        *if (expedition_role = "scout")
            *set perception +3
            *set group_cohesion +5
            You notice faint glimmers on the roots—Runethic glyphs indicating direction.  
            You lead the group through twists and turns. After a few dizzying minutes, light filters through the canopy ahead.  
            *goto laby_exit
        *else
            *set group_cohesion -10
            The roots respond unpredictably to your directions. You find yourself doubling back more than once.  
            *goto laby_exit
    #Ask Zara to communicate with the roots.
        *set zara_relationship +2
        Zara places her hands on a root and murmurs Kor'aelin words: *sil'lan kor'ra* — "together-gentleness heart-flow."  
        The roots rumble and shift, clearing a path.  
        *set group_cohesion +10
        *goto laby_exit
    #Attempt to force your way through using brute magic.
        *set individual_power +4
        *set group_cohesion -15
        You channel energy and burn through a tangled wall. The smell of scorched wood fills the air. The roots shudder in pain, and the path behind you collapses.  
        "Easy!" Izack shouts. "It's alive!"  
        *goto laby_exit

*label laby_exit
After much effort (and possibly some apologizing), you emerge from the labyrinth. The roots close behind you, leaving no trace of the path you took.  
Polly flutters back to your shoulder. "At least you didn't end up as compost," she says.
*return

*comment Mirror of Truth
*label mirror_truth
An ancient pool lies ahead, its surface perfectly still. As you approach, it shimmers and rises into a vertical plane, reflecting not just your face but your desires, fears, and possible futures.  
Aria warns, "The Mirror doesn't lie. But it doesn't always tell the truth you expect."

*choice
    #Look into the mirror alone.
        *set stress +3
        *set philosophical_depth +3
        The reflection shows you at the center of a vast Spiral, friends and lovers orbiting around you. In some loops, you are alone; in others, you are surrounded by laughter.  
        You realize you crave connection as much as you fear losing yourself.  
        *if (romantic_interest = "none" and (relationship_zara > 40 or relationship_izack > 40 or relationship_aria > 40))
            The mirror flickers, offering a glimpse of you and one of them holding hands beneath the World Tree.  
            A spark of hope flares in your chest.  
        *goto mirror_exit
    #Invite the team to join and see the reflection together.
        *set collaboration +4
        *set empathy +2
        Everyone holds hands and looks into the mirror. It shows a tapestry of moments where you work together, fail together, and laugh together.  
        The bonds between you strengthen; group_cohesion rises.  
        *set group_cohesion +10
        *goto mirror_exit
    #Refuse to look; avert your gaze.
        *set stress +1
        *set individual_power +2
        You sense the Mirror's surface ripple as you pass without looking.  
        It feels like skipping an important page, but you keep your secrets to yourself.  
        *goto mirror_exit

*label mirror_exit
Polly shakes her feathers. "Self-reflection can be useful," she says, "if you actually pay attention to it."  
You continue deeper into the forest.  
*return

*comment Memory Moss trial
*label memory_moss
A carpet of vivid green moss stretches across your path. When you step on it, visions flood your mind: memories, real and imagined, of times you felt strong, weak, loved, and alone.  
Your group's cohesion is tested by what is revealed.  

*choice
    #Share a painful memory with the group.
        *set vulnerability +5
        *set collaboration +3
        You describe a moment when you failed someone important to you. The moss glows gently, absorbing your sadness.  
        Others share their own stories. You all feel lighter afterward.  
        *set group_cohesion +10
        *goto moss_exit
    #Stay silent and focus on your own memories.
        *set stress +5
        *set power +1
        The moss shows you a memory of your beach arrival—the moment Clay formed from need. You re-experience the weight of responsibility.  
        You carry the lesson forward but don't share it.  
        *set group_cohesion -5
        *goto moss_exit
    #Tell a joke to break the tension.
        *set joy +3
        *set polly_relationship +3
        You quip something about the moss being a better listener than most professors.  
        Laughter ripples through the group. The moss seems to vibrate happily.  
        *set group_cohesion +5
        *goto moss_exit

*label moss_exit
Polly hops along the moss. "Better a field of memories than a field of nettles," she quips.  
You move on, new stories woven into your shared history.

*comment Guardian negotiation trial
*label guardian_negotiation
An ancient, vine-covered stone figure blocks your path. Its eyes glow with Runethic runes.  
When it speaks, its voice is the groan of tectonic plates: "State your purpose, Spiral-walkers."

*choice
    #Address it in Kor'aelin, inviting collaboration.
        *set collaboration +4
        *set knowledge +2
        You step forward and say, *sil'nav vel'ra med'gal* — "diversity invitation learning-strength."  
        The guardian tilts its head, then steps aside.  
        *set group_cohesion +10
        "You have respect for language and life," it rumbles. "Proceed."
        *goto guardian_exit
    #Speak Runethic, asserting your authority.
        *set power +4
        *set individual_power +2
        You intone, *Vel'ar nos med'ar thular syn'ar nuu*, the ancient invocation.  
        The guardian considers your words, then nods slowly. "Old tongue spoken by young voice," it says. "Be cautious with old power."  
        It moves aside.  
        *goto guardian_exit
    #Let Zara negotiate in Diplomatic Avali.
        *set zara_relationship +3
        *set diplomacy +3
        Zara steps forward, speaking Avali phrases of respect and intent.  
        The guardian's stone brows raise in surprise; clearly it does not often hear the common tongue used with such nuance.  
        "Interesting," it says. "Pass, and remember this language shapes hearts."  
        *set group_cohesion +5
        *goto guardian_exit

*label guardian_exit
Polly flutters onto the guardian's shoulder as you pass. "He'll tell everyone you sang to him," she whispers. "Ancient statues gossip more than you think."  
You continue on, grateful for your varied linguistic repertoire.  
*return

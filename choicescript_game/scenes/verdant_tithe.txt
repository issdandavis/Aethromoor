The portal opens onto an ocean of green.

*line_break

Trees larger than Avalon's towers rise into mist, their canopy creating a twilight world below where shafts of emerald light pierce through like columns in a living cathedral. The air itself feels [i]alive[/i]—thick with the scent of growing things, loam, ancient bark, and something else entirely.

Awareness.

*line_break

You can feel the forest [i]noticing[/i] you. Not hostile. Not welcoming either. Just... aware. Like walking into a room where everyone turns to look.

[i]"Welcome to the Verdant Tithe. Try not to think too loudly—the trees here literally read your mind. And yes, they're judging you. They've had millions of years to develop opinions."[/i]

*page_break

Izack leads this expedition personally, his presence calm and grounding amid the forest's overwhelming presence.

"Welcome to one of Avalon's transplanted biomes," he says, his voice resonating with the quiet authority of someone who belongs here. "The Verdant Tithe was drawn from the ancient forests of Nirestal. Here, every thought has weight. Every emotion leaves a trace."

*line_break

As if to demonstrate, a vine near you shifts—slowly, purposefully—reaching toward a student who's thinking intensely about their family. The plant seems to [i]sense[/i] the emotion, responding to homesickness like a flower turning toward the sun.

"The Thoughtvines are just the beginning," Izack continues. "In the deep forest, the trees themselves remember every person who's passed through. They carry centuries of human thought like rings in their bark."

*choice
    #"How do we keep the forest from reading everything?"
        Izack smiles. "You can't prevent it entirely. But you can learn to quiet your surface thoughts—let the deeper ones sink below where casual observation can't reach."

        He demonstrates, his expression going still. The nearby vines, which had been subtly leaning toward him, relax and turn away.

        "The forest respects boundaries, if you learn to create them."

        [i]"Translation: think boring thoughts and the vines get bored. Think interesting thoughts and suddenly you've got a botanical audience. I've been practicing 'empty head' for three thousand years. Very effective."[/i]

        *set mind_quiet +5
        *goto forest_first_steps

    #"What does the forest do with the thoughts it reads?"
        "Nothing malicious," Izack assures you. "The Tithe takes a piece of your consciousness as payment for passage—usually just surface thoughts or recent memories. In return, it offers guidance and protection."

        [i]"Think of it like a museum that charges admission in memories instead of coins. You'll probably forget what you had for breakfast yesterday. In exchange, the forest won't let anything eat you. Fair trade, honestly."[/i]

        *goto forest_first_steps

    #Stay quiet and focus on keeping your mind calm.
        You don't speak. Instead, you try to still your thoughts, letting them settle like sediment in water.

        The nearest vine, which had been drifting toward you, pauses. Considers. Then slowly turns away.

        Izack notices and nods approvingly. "Already learning. Good."

Your group begins walking the forest path. The ground is soft with centuries of fallen leaves, each step releasing the scent of earth and green growth.

*line_break

Around you, luminescent fungi bloom in response to your footsteps—pale blue, soft gold, vibrant purple. They light the path like lanterns, then fade behind you, creating a moving corridor of soft light.

[i]"The fungi are the forest's nervous system. Every step you take sends signals through their network. Right now, every tree in a mile radius knows exactly where you are, how many of you there are, and—roughly—what mood you're in."[/i]

*page_break

You can hear whispers in the rustling leaves. Not words, exactly, but something close to meaning. The forest murmuring to itself about the visitors passing through.

One of the other students stumbles, their anxiety spiking—and immediately, vines shift throughout the surrounding area, orienting toward the emotional disturbance.

"Easy," Izack says gently. "Fear feeds them. Calm starves them. You control what they see by controlling what you feel."

*choice
    #Reach out to help the anxious student calm down.
        You move to their side, placing a hand on their shoulder. "Breathe. Focus on something simple—a happy memory, a favorite song."

        The student's breathing slows. The vines, sensing the emotional shift, gradually lose interest and drift away.

        Izack watches with approval. "Collaborative calming. Excellent. The forest responds better to collective peace than individual struggle."

        *goto forest_path_split

    #Focus on keeping your own mind calm—set an example.
        You breathe slowly, deliberately. Let your thoughts become still water. The vines near you turn away, uninterested in such a quiet mind.

        The anxious student notices, tries to copy your technique. Gradually, they calm.

        [i]"Nothing like peer pressure to motivate emotional regulation. Whatever works."[/i]

        *set mind_quiet +10
        *goto forest_path_split

    #Observe curiously—how exactly do the vines track emotions?
        You watch the vines closely, trying to understand their mechanism. They seem to sense not thoughts themselves, but the [i]energy[/i] of thoughts—emotional charge, intensity, focus.

        Fascinating. The forest isn't reading minds so much as reading souls.

The path ahead suddenly splits into three directions.

*line_break

Each trail seems to call to different aspects of your mind. One whispers of dreams and possibility. Another thrums with the pulse of shared consciousness. The third feels ancient beyond measure—a summons from something vast and patient.

Izack stops, gesturing at the diverging paths with something like reverence.

*page_break

"The forest is testing you. It wants to know what kind of mind you have—what you seek, what you fear, what you're capable of becoming."

He points to each path in turn:

"The silver trees are Dreamwillows. They show visions of possible futures—all of them, not just the pleasant ones."

"That trail leads deeper into the Thoughtvine network. You'll experience what true connection feels like—minds braiding together into something greater."

"And that glow in the distance..." He pauses. "The Heartwood Tree. The forest's heart and mind made manifest. It calls only those it wishes to teach."

*line_break

[i]"Three paths, three lessons, three very different ways to have a forest rummage through your psyche. Choose wisely. Or don't. The forest will teach you something either way."[/i]

*label forest_guided_path

Instead of choosing, you quiet your mind completely. Let your thoughts become still. Wait.

*line_break

The forest notices.

Vines drift toward you—but not aggressively. Curiously. One touches your hand, gentle as a greeting, and suddenly you [i]know[/i] where you're meant to go.

Not a thought. Not a word. Just certainty, planted in your mind like a seed.

*page_break

[i]"Did the forest just... choose for you? That's either a very good sign or a very bad one. With sentient forests, it's hard to tell."[/i]

Izack's eyes widen slightly. "The Tithe rarely guides anyone directly. It must have seen something in you."

The Dreamwillow grove is breathtaking.

*line_break

Silver leaves shimmer overhead like mirrors catching starlight. The air is heavy with possibility—every breath tastes like [i]potential[/i], like the moment before a choice is made. The trees themselves seem to hum with futures yet to be written.

Izack gestures for the group to sit beneath the largest tree, its trunk wider than a house, its bark silver-white and smooth as glass.

*page_break

"Dreamwillows show visions of possible futures," he explains softly. "But be warned—they show [i]all[/i] possibilities, not just pleasant ones. The forest wants you to understand that every choice branches reality."

[i]"Think of it as aggressive career counseling. 'Here are all the ways your life could go, including the really depressing ones.' Very motivating."[/i]

*line_break

You lean against the silvery bark. It's warm despite the shade, and the moment you touch it, drowsiness overtakes you...

*goto dreamwillow_visions

*label dreamwillow_visions

Your vision blurs. Reality softens. And suddenly you're [i]seeing[/i]—

*line_break

—yourself, years older, standing at the heart of Avalon's Spiral Spire. Dozens of students surround you, their minds linked with yours in a complex collaborative spell. You're teaching them what Izack taught you. The vision feels warm, right, [i]possible[/i].

*page_break

The image shifts—

*line_break

—yourself, alone in a tower. Surrounded by books and power. You've mastered magic beyond what anyone thought possible, but there's no one to share it with. Everyone you loved has drifted away, one by one, unable to match your ascent. The tower is cold. You are cold. Empty.

*page_break

The vision shifts again—

*line_break

—yourself, standing at a threshold between Avalon and something [i]else[/i]. The demon realm Varn'ka'zul pulses beyond the barrier like a wound in reality. You're making a choice—a choice that will determine the fate of both worlds. The weight of it is crushing.

But somehow, you're strong enough to bear it.

*page_break

The visions fade. You gasp, returning to the present, silver leaves rustling overhead.

[i]"The Dreamwillows don't tell you which future is 'right.' They just show you that your choices matter. What you do now echoes forward. No pressure or anything."[/i]

Izack's hand rests on your shoulder, grounding you.

"The forest has shown you its deepest lesson: magic is choice, and every choice shapes not just you, but the world around you."

*choice
    #"The first vision—teaching others, collaborative magic—that's what I want."
        *set collaboration +15

        "Then pursue it," Izack says simply. "Every choice you make from this moment shapes whether that future becomes real."

        *goto dreamwillow_conclusion

    #"The lonely tower terrified me. How do I avoid that path?"
        Izack's expression softens. "By remembering that power without connection is just another kind of prison. The strongest magic is woven together, not hoarded alone."

        [i]"Also, maybe don't lock yourself in towers. Just a thought. Towers are bad for social lives."[/i]

        *set collaboration +10
        *goto dreamwillow_conclusion

    #"That final vision—the choice between worlds—is that real? Will that happen?"
        "Perhaps." Izack's voice is careful. "The Dreamwillows show possibilities, not certainties. But they don't show impossibilities either."

        He meets your eyes.

        "If that moment comes, you'll be ready. Or you won't. That's what choices are."

As you leave the grove, a single silver leaf detaches from the Dreamwillow and drifts down to you. You catch it instinctively.

*line_break

The leaf is warm, and when you hold it, you can still sense echoes of possibility—not visions, but [i]potential[/i]. A reminder that the future isn't fixed.

[i]"A Dreamwillow leaf. They're incredibly rare gifts. Hold onto that—it'll tingle when you're about to make a choice that matters. Very useful. Also mildly annoying when you're just trying to decide what to eat for dinner."[/i]

It's not invasive. More like your consciousness is expanding to include the forest itself. Boundaries blur. You can sense the other students' wonder, Izack's pride, Polly's amused observation—all of it flowing together like streams joining a river.

You see the Dryads singing this forest into awareness, feel the moment it first began to [i]think[/i]. You witness battles fought beneath these canopies, lovers meeting in secret clearings, children being born and elders passing on.

"Too fast," you manage.

And then you see it.

The Heartwood Tree.

*line_break

It's not just big—it's [i]fundamental[/i]. A tree so massive it seems less like a plant and more like a pillar holding up the sky. Its bark pulses like a heartbeat. Its roots glow where they meet the ground, spreading in all directions like veins carrying life to every corner of the forest.

You can feel its awareness—vast, patient, kind but utterly inhuman. A consciousness that was ancient when your ancestors' ancestors were learning to use fire.

*page_break

[i]*Unusually quiet* "This is one of the oldest living things in any realm. It was here before Avalon, before Izack, before most of what we call civilization. It's the forest's heart and mind made manifest. I've been alive three thousand years, and this tree makes me feel young."[/i]

Izack bows respectfully. After a moment, you find yourself doing the same.

You can feel it—the whisper of leaves in your mind, the slow growth of roots beneath your feet even when you stand on stone, the patient wisdom of trees that have lived a thousand years.

*label heartwood_path

The path leads deep into the forest's heart, where even Izack walks with reverence.

*line_break

The trees here are impossibly ancient, their bark inscribed with natural runes that glow faintly with their own inner light. The air thrums with old magic.

*line_break

At the center stands a tree unlike any other.

*page_break

[b]The Heartwood Tree.[/b]

*line_break

It's massive beyond belief, with bark that seems to pulse like a heartbeat and roots that disappear into glowing earth. You can feel its awareness—vast, patient, kind but utterly inhuman.

*line_break

[i]*Unusually quiet* "This is one of the oldest living things in any realm. It was here before Avalon, before Izack, before most of what we call civilization. It's the forest's heart and mind made manifest."[/i]

*page_break

Izack bows respectfully to the tree. "The Heartwood only reveals itself to those it wishes to teach. You've been [i]called[/i] here."

*line_break

As you approach, the tree's roots shift, creating a natural seat at its base. The invitation is clear.

*line_break

You sit.

*page_break

The moment you touch the Heartwood, understanding floods through you:

You feel the interconnection of all living things. Every breath you take feeds the plants. Every plant's gift feeds you. The cycle has no beginning and no end—just an eternal dance of giving and receiving.

You understand that magic isn't something you [i]do[/i]. It's something you [i]participate in[/i]. A conversation, not a command. A collaboration between yourself and everything that exists.

*line_break

Time stretches. Or maybe it contracts. Hard to tell. You experience centuries in heartbeats—the forest's memory, its dreams, its hopes for the future.

And then, gently, you return to yourself.

*page_break

The Heartwood extends a branch toward you. At its tip hangs a single fruit—golden, glowing with concentrated life essence, impossibly beautiful.

An offering.

[i]"...I've visited this tree with Izack a hundred times. It's never offered its fruit before. Ever. To anyone."[/i]

Izack's voice is barely a whisper. "If you eat that, you'll be bonded to the forest forever. You'll carry a piece of the Verdant Tithe in your soul. You'll be able to feel the forest across any distance—and it will feel you."

"That's not a small thing," he adds. "That's a [i]transformation[/i]."

*choice
    #Accept the fruit and bond with the forest's ancient wisdom.

            *goto heartwood_question

*label heartwood_acceptance

Your hand trembles as you reach for the fruit.

*line_break

It's warm. Heavier than it looks. When you bite into it, golden juice runs down your chin, and flavor explodes across your tongue—not sweet or sour or savory, but [i]alive[/i]. Tasting of sunlight and rain and deep earth and growing things.

*page_break

And then the bond snaps into place.

*line_break

You gasp. Suddenly you can feel [i]everything[/i]—every tree, every vine, every root and leaf and flower in the Verdant Tithe. The forest isn't just around you anymore. It's [i]in[/i] you. Part of you.

You are the forest, and the forest is you.

[i]"...I don't have words for this. You just became a Heartwood Guardian. The forest's chosen champion. The last one was before I was born, and I'm ancient."[/i]

*page_break

Izack watches with something approaching awe.

"The forest has claimed you," he says softly. "You'll never be alone again. And you'll carry responsibilities others can't imagine."

He bows to you—genuinely, not perfunctorily.

"Welcome, Guardian."

"I'm honored," you say, and you mean it. "But this gift is too great. I'm not ready for what it means."

*line_break

The branch withdraws slowly—not offended, but perhaps... understanding. The fruit fades back into the leaves, still glowing, waiting for someone else.

Or waiting for you, someday, when you're ready.

*page_break

Izack lets out a breath. "There's wisdom in knowing your limits. The forest respects that."

[i]"You just turned down immortal forest communion because you knew yourself well enough to say no. That's... actually incredibly mature. The Heartwood will remember. It's patient. If you change your mind in fifty years, it'll still be here."[/i]

*label heartwood_question

Instead of reaching for the fruit, you place your hand on the Heartwood's bark and open your mind.

[i]Why me?[/i]

*line_break

The answer comes not in words but in [i]knowing[/i]:

You see yourself through the forest's eyes. Not your face, not your body—your [i]essence[/i]. The way you've approached everything here with curiosity rather than fear. The way you've respected boundaries while remaining open. The way your consciousness [i]fits[/i] with the forest's rhythms.

*page_break

The Heartwood chose you because you're ready to be chosen. Because you asked instead of assumed. Because you listened.

[i]"The tree literally just told you 'because you're you.' I'd be annoyed by how vague that is if it wasn't also kind of beautiful."[/i]

Izack nods slowly. "The Heartwood doesn't explain itself often. You should feel honored."

Now you understand the fruit's weight. And you can choose with clear eyes.

The path back to the portal feels different now. The forest isn't just watching you anymore—it's [i]acknowledging[/i] you. Vines drift aside as you approach. Fungi light your path more brightly. Leaves whisper something that might be farewell.

    You can feel the Tithe's presence in your mind, warm and welcoming. It will be with you always now, a connection that transcends distance.

*else
    You carry the forest's lessons with you: patience, connection, the understanding that all life is woven together.

*page_break

As you reach the portal back to Avalon, Izack turns to address the group.

"The Verdant Tithe teaches different lessons to different minds. What matters isn't which path you walked, but what you learned on it."

*line_break

[i]"Translation: it's not a competition. Unless you bonded with the Heartwood, in which case, congratulations, you win. But don't be smug about it—the forest can tell."[/i]

You step through the portal, carrying the Verdant Tithe's gift:

*if artifact_earned = "heartwood_bond"
    The eternal bond of a Heartwood Guardian, champion of the forest's ancient purpose.
*elseif artifact_earned = "forest_bond"
    A permanent connection to the Thoughtvines, the forest always present in the back of your mind.
*elseif artifact_earned = "dreamwillow_leaf"
    A silver Dreamwillow leaf that tingles when important choices approach.
*else
    Memories of connection and possibility—and the knowledge that you can always return.

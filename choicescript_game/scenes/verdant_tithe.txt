The portal opens onto a world of green.

*line_break

Not just green—[i]Green[/i]. A thousand shades of it, layered so thickly that the air itself seems tinted emerald. Vines coil and uncoil like curious serpents. Massive trees arch overhead, their canopies creating a cathedral of living wood.

And beneath it all, you feel... weight.

*line_break

Not physical weight. Mental weight. Like the forest is [i]thinking[/i] at you, and your own thoughts are suddenly heavier, more substantial, more [i]real[/i].

[i]"Welcome to the Verdant Tithe. Fair warning: your thoughts are not private here. The forest reads them like an open book. Try not to think anything embarrassing. Or do, actually—I enjoy watching students panic when trees start judging them."[/i]

*page_break

Zara leads this expedition, her hybrid features seeming more pronounced here—as if the forest recognizes something kindred in her mixed heritage.

"The Verdant Tithe," she says softly, "is one of the oldest living consciousnesses in any realm. Every plant here is connected. Every root touches every other root. They think together. Dream together."

*line_break

She touches a nearby tree trunk reverently.

"And they remember. Every person who's ever walked here left a thought-imprint. The forest absorbed it, learned from it, kept it."

*choice
    #"What happens if we think something the forest doesn't like?"
        Zara's expression becomes serious.

        "The forest doesn't judge morally. But it does respond to intention. Kind thoughts make the path easier. Hostile thoughts make everything... difficult."

        She gestures to a patch of vines that writhe more aggressively than the others.

        "A student three years ago came in thinking about how they'd tear down forests to build cities. The vines trapped them for six hours. Not to hurt—just to teach."

        [i]"The Verdant Tithe is petty in the most educational way possible. Think bad thoughts, get tangled by judgmental shrubbery. It's like therapy, but greener."[/i]

        *set forest_trust +5
        *goto verdant_introduction

    #"This is beautiful. I've never felt anything like this."
        Your genuine wonder ripples out through the forest.

        Immediately, flowers bloom on nearby vines—tiny white blossoms that weren't there a moment ago. The forest heard you. And it responded with beauty of its own.

        Zara smiles. "The forest likes you already. Good start."

        [i]"Congratulations, you complimented a forest and it gave you flowers. This is either very sweet or very weird, and I haven't decided which yet."[/i]

        *set forest_trust +10
        *goto verdant_introduction

    #Study the vines more closely before committing to any emotional response.
        You kneel beside a coiling vine, watching its movement. There's intelligence here—not human intelligence, but something alien and ancient.

        The vine seems to notice your attention. It reaches out slowly, curious, and brushes against your hand. Not threatening. Exploring.

        *line_break

        Zara nods approvingly. "The forest respects observation. You're treating it like a thinking being, not just scenery. That's important."

        *set forest_trust +8
        *goto verdant_introduction

*label verdant_introduction

Zara gathers the group at the edge of a clearing where three paths diverge into the forest depths.

"The Verdant Tithe," she explains, "has three primary consciousnesses. Think of them as... different personalities within the same vast mind."

*line_break

She points to the leftmost path, where vines seem to pulse with faint light.

"That way leads to the Thoughtvine—the analytical aspect. It processes information, solves problems, thinks in patterns. Good for students who want to understand how the forest's intelligence works."

*page_break

The middle path glows with soft, dreamlike colors that shift and flow.

"That path leads to the Dreamwillow—the creative, emotional aspect. It feels more than it thinks. Shows visions. Shares emotions across its root network. For students who want to [i]experience[/i] the forest rather than analyze it."

*page_break

The rightmost path is darker, older, lined with trees that dwarf everything else.

"And that path leads to the Heartwood Tree—the ancient core. The first tree. The origin of the entire forest's consciousness. It rarely speaks to anyone. But when it does..."

Zara trails off, her expression reverent.

*line_break

[i]"Translation: one path is for nerds, one is for dreamers, and one is for people who want to talk to a tree older than most civilizations. Choose wisely—or don't. Chaos is educational."[/i]

*choice
    #"I want to understand the Thoughtvine. How does a forest think?"

*label thoughtvine_path

You step onto the leftmost path.

Immediately, the vines around you begin to glow brighter—bioluminescent patterns that pulse like neurons firing. You can almost [i]see[/i] thoughts moving through them.

*line_break

Zara follows at a respectful distance. "The Thoughtvine will test you. It likes puzzles. Problems. Challenges. Stay calm and think clearly."

[i]"Also, try not to panic when plants start reading your mind and commenting on your problem-solving process. It's rude, but they're very thorough."[/i]

*page_break

The path ahead suddenly divides into a maze.

Not a physical maze—the trees haven't moved. But you can [i]feel[/i] the mental pathways branching, forking, creating a labyrinth of decisions.

*line_break

A voice blooms in your mind—not words, but concepts assembling themselves into meaning:

[i]SHOW ME HOW YOU THINK. SOLVE THE PATTERN.[/i]

*choice
    #Look for the logical pattern—there must be a sequence to follow.
        You study the maze carefully.

        Each turn is marked with a different type of leaf. Oak. Maple. Birch. Willow. There's a botanical sequence here if you can just identify it.

        *line_break

        You trace the pattern with your eyes, following the logic of seasonal growth, categorizing each species by its ecological niche.

        *page_break

        The Thoughtvine hums approval through your consciousness.

        [i]LOGIC. CATEGORIZATION. PATTERN RECOGNITION. EFFICIENT.[/i]

        The maze simplifies. The "correct" path glows brighter, guiding you through.

        *set thoughtvine_bond +15
        *set forest_trust +10
        *goto thoughtvine_trial_two

    #Feel which path calls to you—intuition is a form of thinking too.
        You close your eyes and let your mind quiet.

        The Thoughtvine wants to see how you think? Fine. You'll show it that thinking isn't just logic—it's also instinct, intuition, the subconscious patterns your mind recognizes without conscious effort.

        *line_break

        You walk forward, turning when something feels right, pausing when something feels wrong.

        *page_break

        The Thoughtvine seems... surprised?

        [i]INTUITION. PATTERN RECOGNITION WITHOUT CONSCIOUS PROCESSING. INTERESTING. NON-LINEAR THINKING.[/i]

        The maze rearranges itself around you, creating a path that matches your intuitive leaps.

        *set thoughtvine_bond +12
        *set collaboration +5
        *goto thoughtvine_trial_two

    #Ask the Thoughtvine directly—why should you solve it alone if this is about understanding each other?
        "Thoughtvine," you say aloud, "you want to understand how I think. But thinking is a conversation. Help me understand how [i]you[/i] think first."

        *line_break

        Silence.

        Then: [i]...COLLABORATIVE APPROACH. UNUSUAL. EXPLAIN.[/i]

        *page_break

        "You're testing me," you say, "but real understanding is mutual. Show me your pattern, and I'll show you mine."

        *line_break

        For a long moment, nothing happens.

        Then the vines [i]open[/i].

        Not physically—mentally. You feel the Thoughtvine's consciousness reach out and [i]show[/i] you how it thinks. Information flowing through root networks. Distributed processing. Thousands of plants thinking as one.

        *page_break

        [i]YOU ASKED TO UNDERSTAND RATHER THAN CONQUER. THIS IS... COLLABORATIVE.[/i]

        The maze dissolves entirely. The Thoughtvine offers you a direct path.

Deeper in the forest, the Thoughtvine presents another challenge.

A clearing filled with objects—stones, bones, feathers, pieces of wood. Random debris, or so it seems.

*line_break

[i]ORGANIZE. SHOW ME YOUR CATEGORIES.[/i]

*choice
    #Organize by physical properties—size, weight, material.
        You sort methodically.

        Stones by size. Organic materials separated from inorganic. Everything categorized by measurable, objective criteria.

        [i]CLEAR. SYSTEMATIC. REPLICABLE. YOUR MIND FAVORS ORDER.[/i]

        *set thoughtvine_bond +10
        *goto thoughtvine_gift

    #Organize by story—which objects might have been used together, shared purposes.
        You look at the objects differently.

        This bone and this feather—from the same bird, perhaps? These stones smoothed by the same river? You create categories based on narrative, on connection, on shared history.

        *line_break

        [i]CONTEXTUAL. RELATIONAL. YOUR MIND SEEKS MEANING BEYOND FACTS. CREATIVE LOGIC.[/i]

        *set thoughtvine_bond +15
        *set collaboration +5
        *goto thoughtvine_gift

    #Don't organize—ask the Thoughtvine what organizational system it prefers.
        "You're testing my thinking," you say, "but you have a preferred answer, don't you? What organizational system does the forest use?"

        *page_break

        [i]...YOU QUESTION THE QUESTION ITSELF. META-COGNITIVE APPROACH. SHOW ME.[/i]

        The Thoughtvine opens its consciousness again, and you see: the forest doesn't organize by human categories at all. It thinks in ecological relationships. Predator-prey. Symbiosis. Nutrient cycles.

        *line_break

        You reorganize the objects according to what you've learned—grouping them by their role in forest ecosystems.

        [i]YOU LEARNED MY LANGUAGE. ADAPTED YOUR THINKING. THIS IS TRUE COLLABORATION.[/i]

[i]YOU HAVE SHOWN ME YOUR MIND. I OFFER YOU UNDERSTANDING IN RETURN.[/i]

*line_break

Vines coil around your wrist—gently, carefully. They glow brighter, and then you [i]feel[/i] it.

*page_break

A connection. Not control—partnership. You can sense the Thoughtvine's consciousness now, its vast analytical processing power accessible when you need it.

The Thoughtvine leads you deeper than most students ever reach.

Here, the bioluminescent patterns are so intense they illuminate the forest like a neural network made visible. You can see thoughts moving through the vines—actual thoughts, represented as pulses of light.

*line_break

[i]YOU TREATED ME AS EQUAL. ASKED TO UNDERSTAND RATHER THAN CONTROL. THIS IS RARE.[/i]

*page_break

The central Thoughtvine emerges from the forest floor—a massive mass of glowing vines that pulse with concentrated intelligence.

[i]I OFFER YOU PARTNERSHIP. THINK WITH ME. LEARN WITH ME. BECOME PART OF THE NETWORK.[/i]

*choice
    #Accept the partnership—become part of the Thoughtvine's consciousness.
        "Yes," you whisper. "I want to understand."

        The vines wrap around you—not constricting, but connecting. You feel your mind expand outward, joining the vast distributed intelligence of the forest.

        *page_break

        For a moment, you think with a thousand minds at once.

        You process information the way the forest does—seeing patterns in everything, making connections human minds miss, solving problems through distributed cognition.

        *line_break

        When the connection stabilizes, you're still yourself. But you're also [i]more[/i]. Part of something bigger.

*comment ================================================

*label dreamwillow_path

You step onto the middle path.

The air immediately feels different—thicker, almost liquid. Colors become more vivid. Sounds grow muffled. Reality seems to bend slightly at the edges.

*line_break

Zara's voice sounds distant: "The Dreamwillow doesn't think in words or logic. It feels. Dreams. Creates. Let it show you what it wants to show you."

[i]"Translation: you're about to trip absolute balls on forest emotions, and there's nothing you can do about it. Enjoy the magical hallucinations."[/i]

*page_break

The first vision hits you without warning.

Suddenly you're seeing through the Dreamwillow's awareness—experiencing the forest the way it experiences itself.

*line_break

You feel sunlight as joy. Rain as relief. Wind as laughter. The forest doesn't think about these things—it [i]feels[/i] them, directly and completely.

*page_break

And then you feel the other students.

Every person in the expedition appears in your awareness—not as visual images, but as emotional presences. Anxiety. Curiosity. Wonder. Fear. Love.

*line_break

The Dreamwillow is showing you that it experiences every living thing through emotion, not thought.

[i]"Well. This is intimate. The forest just made you experience everyone's feelings simultaneously. How's that going for you?"[/i]

*choice
    #Open yourself to the emotions—let yourself feel everything the Dreamwillow feels.
        You stop resisting.

        The wave of emotion crashes over you, and instead of drowning, you [i]surf[/i] it.

        *line_break

        Joy. Sorrow. Anger. Peace. Every emotion the forest has absorbed from centuries of visitors, flowing through you like a river.

        It's overwhelming. It's beautiful. It's [i]real[/i].

        *page_break

        The Dreamwillow wraps around your consciousness like a warm embrace.

        You feel its approval—not as thought, but as a surge of affection that makes flowers bloom in your peripheral vision.

        You acknowledge the emotions without letting them consume you.

        Feel them, yes. But maintain your own emotional center. Experience without losing yourself.

        *line_break

        It's like standing in an ocean and letting waves wash over you without being pulled under. The Dreamwillow's emotions are intense, but you remain anchored.

        *page_break

        The Dreamwillow seems... curious? Impressed?

        Most people either drown or shut down. You're doing neither. You're experiencing while maintaining self.

        The Dreamwillow heard you. It's... apologizing? You feel a wave of sheepish concern, like a puppy that played too roughly.

        *page_break

        Now the emotions come one at a time, manageable doses. The Dreamwillow is learning to communicate at your pace.

        [i]"You set boundaries with an emotionally overeager forest and it respected them. That's actually really healthy. Points for communication."[/i]

The Dreamwillow offers you a deeper vision.

You're standing beneath a massive willow tree—so large its branches create a canopy that blocks out the sky. Its bark glows with soft, pulsing light.

*line_break

And then you're not standing anymore.

You're [i]inside[/i] the tree.

*page_break

The Dreamwillow shows you its dreams.

Visions of the forest's past: ancient peoples who lived in harmony with the trees, learning to listen to the wood's whispers.

*line_break

Visions of the future: possibilities branching like the tree's own limbs. Some show the forest growing, spreading. Others show it burning, dying.

*page_break

And then it shows you [i]your[/i] dreams.

Things you want. Things you fear. Things you haven't admitted even to yourself.

*line_break

The Dreamwillow doesn't judge them. It simply reflects them back to you, letting you see your own heart clearly.

*choice
    #Accept what you see—this is who you really are.
        You look at your reflected dreams without flinching.

        Yes. This is you. All of it—the beautiful parts and the messy parts and the parts you wish you could change.

        *line_break

        The Dreamwillow wraps around your heart like a blanket.

        You feel it accepting you completely. Not despite your flaws, but including them. Loving the whole truth of who you are.

        *page_break

        When the vision fades, something has changed.

        You can still feel the Dreamwillow's presence—a warm, accepting consciousness that will always reflect your truth back to you.

The temperature drops. Not cold, exactly—but solemn. The trees here are ancient beyond measure, their trunks so massive ten people couldn't encircle them.

*line_break

Zara's expression is reverent. "The Heartwood Tree rarely speaks to anyone. Be respectful. Be honest. And be patient."

[i]"You're about to meet a tree older than recorded history. If it talks to you, it'll probably be cryptic and frustratingly wise. Ancient things always are."[/i]

The path leads deeper into silence.

No birdsong here. No rustling leaves. Just the profound quiet of something so old it exists outside normal time.

*line_break

And then you see it.

*page_break

The Heartwood Tree.

It's impossible. Massive. Its trunk is wider than most buildings, its bark dark and seamed with age beyond comprehension. Roots the size of houses snake across the ground.

*line_break

But it's not the size that takes your breath away.

It's the [i]presence[/i].

*page_break

This tree has witnessed civilizations rise and fall. Has sheltered countless lives. Has grown while empires crumbled to dust around it.

You can feel its age pressing against your consciousness—not threatening, just... vast.

        Possible futures branch out before you—dozens, hundreds, all stemming from choices not yet made. Some show Avalon thriving. Others show it burning. Some show you as a great mage. Others show you broken, failed.

        *line_break

        But they're all [i]possible[/i]. None are certain.

        [b]ARE YOU CERTAIN?[/b]

        "Yes."

        *page_break

        The Heartwood shows you reality as it truly is.

        You see the world without human interpretation, without bias, without the stories you tell yourself to make sense of chaos.

        *line_break

        You see people as they truly are—not who they pretend to be. You see magic as it truly flows—not controlled, but wild, alive, collaborative.

        You see yourself: both more and less than you imagined.

        *page_break

        It's devastating. It's liberating.

        [b]THIS IS TRUTH. CARRY IT CAREFULLY.[/b]

    #"I'm ready. Show me."
        You press your back against the ancient bark and close your eyes.

        At first, nothing happens.

        *page_break

        Then, slowly, your perception... [i]expands[/i].

        You feel your roots—no, the tree's roots—stretching deep into earth. You feel sunlight on your leaves. You feel centuries passing like heartbeats.

        *line_break

        Time slows to a crawl. Or maybe speeds up. You can't tell anymore.

        You experience what it means to be the Heartwood: patient, ancient, unchanging yet growing, witnessing everything while participating in nothing.

        *page_break

        It's overwhelming. It's profound. It changes you fundamentally.

        When you return to your own consciousness, you're not the same person who left it.

        A single leaf falls from the canopy above, landing in your palm. It's ancient, preserved, carrying the Heartwood's essence.

        *page_break

        When you hold it, you feel the tree's presence—distant but real. A connection that will grow over time if you nurture it.

A root rises from the ground, offering you something: a small wooden amulet carved from the Heartwood's own bark, given freely.

The portal back to Avalon shimmers into existence at the forest's edge.

Three days in the Verdant Tithe. A lifetime of lessons about consciousness, connection, and what it means to think together.

*line_break

*if artifact_earned = "Thoughtvine Partnership - Deep Connection"
    You can still feel the Thoughtvine's consciousness humming at the edge of your awareness—thousands of minds, available when you need them.
*elseif artifact_earned = "Dreamwillow Partnership - Shared Dreams"
    The Dreamwillow's warmth surrounds your heart. You'll never feel truly alone again—the forest dreams with you now.
*elseif artifact_earned = "Heartwood Guardian - Ancient Wisdom"
    The Heartwood's ancient patience settles into your bones. You see time differently now, understanding that growth is measured in seasons, not moments.
*else
    The forest's presence fades, but its lessons remain. You've learned that intelligence comes in forms stranger and more beautiful than you imagined.

Zara gathers the group for the return journey.

*if forest_trust >= 25
    "The forest chose you," she says softly. "I can see it in how the vines move around you. That's sacred, ${name}."
*elseif collaboration >= 65
    "You collaborated with the forest instead of trying to control it," she says. "That's the Avalon way. Well done."
*else
    "You survived the Verdant Tithe and learned something valuable," she says. "That's what matters."

[i]"Time to go home. Well, back to Avalon anyway. I have mixed feelings about leaving a sentient forest, but I also enjoy not having my thoughts constantly analyzed by judgmental shrubbery. It's complicated."[/i]

You step through the portal, carrying the Verdant Tithe's gift:

*if artifact_earned = "Thoughtvine Partnership - Deep Connection"
    The ability to think with a forest—accessing distributed intelligence whenever complex problems arise.
*elseif artifact_earned = "Dreamwillow Partnership - Shared Dreams"
    An eternal emotional connection—the forest's dreams woven into your own, providing comfort and insight.
*elseif artifact_earned = "Heartwood Guardian - Ancient Wisdom"
    The mantle of Guardian—protector of ancient wisdom, keeper of the forest's deepest truths.
*elseif artifact_earned = "Thoughtvine Bond"
    A partnership with living intelligence—the Thoughtvine's analytical power available when you need it.
*elseif artifact_earned = "Dreamwillow Vision"
    The ability to see emotional truth—understanding hearts as clearly as the Dreamwillow does.
*elseif artifact_earned = "Heartwood Memory" or artifact_earned = "Heartwood Foresight" or artifact_earned = "Heartwood Truth"
    A gift from the oldest tree—perspective that spans centuries, wisdom that transcends mortal understanding.
*else
    Knowledge of collaborative consciousness—proof that thinking together is more powerful than thinking alone.

The Verdant Tithe fades behind you, but its green wisdom echoes in your memory forever.

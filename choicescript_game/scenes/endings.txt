You step through the portal back to Avalon Academy, and the familiar sight strikes you with unexpected force: home. This place has become home in a way you didn't fully realize until you left and returned.

The Spiral Spire gleams above you, its impossible geometry catching the afternoon light and refracting it into colors that don't exist in the mortal world. The World Tree sapling sways in a breeze that carries the scent of starlight and growing things, its branches reaching toward dimensional boundaries like a child reaching for something just out of grasp. All around you, leylines pulse with gentle light beneath the crystalline pathways, carrying Avalon's living magic through every part of this sentient realm.

You've changed out there, in whichever biome tested you. Everyone who returns from their first expedition changes—but the question is: how much, and in what direction?

*achievement collaborative_master

Izack Thorne himself is waiting in the courtyard, as if he knew the exact moment you'd return. As if Avalon itself told him something important was coming through the portal.

When he sees you—truly sees you, with the dimensional awareness that let him create this entire realm—his eyes widen with recognition and wonder and something that might be awe. He can perceive what you've become: the way the glacier's ancient power flows through you like blood, the living runes dancing beneath your skin in patterns that speak the First Tongue, the fundamental transformation in how you exist in relation to dimensional magic.

You're not just a mage who uses magic anymore. You're someone who partners with it.

*line_break

[b]"Impossible,"[/b] he whispers, and Izack Thorne almost never whispers. [b]"You achieved partnership. True, equal partnership with one of the ancient forces—the kind that doesn't recognize hierarchy or domination, only mutual respect and collaboration. And you did it on your first expedition."[/b]

*page_break

He approaches slowly, reverently, and places a hand on your shoulder. Even through the physical contact, you feel his dimensional awareness brushing against yours—the vast web of magic he maintains spread across your consciousness like a map drawn in light. For a moment, you sense Avalon itself: alive, growing, evolving under his patient guidance, a realm that chose to be sentient because he believed it could.

[b]"${name}, what you've accomplished..."[/b] His voice cracks slightly with emotion. [b]"It took me twenty years of study, failure, and desperate experimentation to achieve my first true partnership. You did it in weeks. You've surpassed my wildest hopes for what Avalon could teach."[/b]

*line_break

Aria Ravencrest emerges from the library tower, her movements precise as always but her expression transformed by something you've never seen on her face before: uncertainty. She's encountering something outside her vast knowledge, and it both unsettles and excites her.

*page_break

She studies you for a long moment with those sharp eyes that miss nothing, and you can practically see her cataloging every change, every subtle shift in your dimensional signature.

[b]"A Collaborative Master,"[/b] she finally says, voice quiet with wonder. [b]"I've only read about them in the oldest texts—the ones written before the Sundering, before dimensional magic fractured into competing schools. Mages who don't just use magic but [i]partner[/i] with it. Who treat power as a conversation rather than a tool, as a relationship rather than a resource."[/b]

*line_break

She inclines her head—a gesture of genuine respect from someone who rarely shows deference to anyone except Izack, and even that took years to develop.

[b]"You will surpass us all, ${name}. Not might. Will. I am as certain of this as I am of the laws of dimensional mechanics. Your name will reshape what we understand magic to be."[/b]

*page_break

Polly lands on your shoulder, her weight familiar and comforting, but she's unusually quiet. No sarcastic commentary. No dramatic narration. Just silence, and you realize: she's moved.

After a long moment, she speaks—and for perhaps the first time in three centuries, there's no armor of humor in her voice:

[i]"I've watched Avalon Academy since before it was an academy—when it was just Izack and a cave and an impossible dream. I've seen thousands of students come through these halls, achieve their degrees, go on to reshape magical society. And I can count on one wing—literally one wing—the number who achieved what you just did."[/i]

*line_break

[i]"You're going to be legendary, ${name}. Truly, genuinely legendary. Your name will be remembered alongside Izack's, alongside the First Mages who discovered dimensional magic in the age before history. Three hundred years from now, students will study your technique. Your partnership. What you've proven is possible."[/i]

*line_break

[i]"I'm honored to have watched your story unfold. And I can't wait to see what comes next."[/i]

*page_break

[b]== SIX MONTHS LATER ==[/b]

*line_break

You stand in the Hall of Threads—a chamber at the heart of the Spiral Spire where dimensional boundaries are visible as shimmering strands of light.

Today is your graduation.

*page_break

But it's not a normal graduation.

Izack has created a new title for you: [b]Collaborative Master[/b]—the first in generations.

*line_break

You don't just graduate from Avalon Academy. You [i]join[/i] it, becoming one of the legendary mages whose name will be spoken for centuries.

*page_break

The glacier's power flows through you, responding to your thoughts as naturally as breathing. When you gesture, runes write themselves in the air. When you speak, dimensional boundaries [i]listen[/i].

And everywhere you go, you feel it—the living presence of magic itself, partnering with you in ways that make power feel less like control and more like [i]collaboration[/i].

*page_break

Polly perches on the podium as Izack places the silver medallion around your neck.

[i]"Well,"[/i] she says, her eyes bright with pride, [i]"I did say I knew how this story would end. But I'll admit—you surprised even me, ${name}."[/i]

Izack Thorne is waiting in the courtyard, his expression thoughtful.

[b]"You achieved partnership with the glacier,"[/b] he says. [b]"That alone is extraordinary. But I sense... you haven't fully embraced what that means yet."[/b]

*line_break

He's right. You can feel the glacier's power, its presence in your mind—but you're still learning what it means to truly [i]partner[/i] with such an ancient force.

*page_break

[b]"You have time,"[/b] Izack continues. [b]"Partnership is not a destination—it's a journey. You've taken the first step. Now you must learn to walk the path."[/b]

*page_break

Over the next months, you study intensively with Izack.

He teaches you how to deepen your connection with the glacier, how to hear its voice more clearly, how to merge your intentions with its ancient wisdom.

*line_break

Slowly, you begin to understand what you've been given.

*page_break

[b]== GRADUATION DAY ==[/b]

*line_break

You graduate with highest honors, bearing the title [b]Partner of the Glacier[/b].

While you haven't yet achieved full Collaborative Mastery, you've accomplished something most mages never even attempt—true partnership with a magical force.

The glacier's presence hums in the back of your mind, constant and reassuring.

You know that in time, as you grow and learn, this partnership will become something extraordinary.

When you return to Avalon Academy, everything feels [i]different[/i].

You can sense every living thing around you—the grass beneath your feet, the trees in the courtyard, even the tiny insects crawling through the soil. All of it connected, all of it alive, all of it part of you now.

*page_break

Zara is waiting for you, her expression shifting to wonder when she sees you.

[b]"You... you bonded with the Heartwood Tree. I can feel it."[/b]

*line_break

She reaches out, her hand hovering near yours, and you feel her life force like a warm flame.

[b]"You're connected to everything now. Every living thing in Avalon, all at once."[/b]

*page_break

She's right. The golden fruit from the Heartwood Tree didn't just give you power—it made you part of the forest's eternal network.

You are a [b]Guardian[/b] now, bonded to the living world in ways that transcend normal magic.

*page_break

*line_break

[b]== YOUR NEW ROLE ==[/b]

*line_break

You don't simply graduate from Avalon Academy.

Instead, you become its first [b]Heartwood Guardian[/b]—a protector of the living magic that flows through the realm.

*page_break

You can feel when anything in Avalon is hurt or threatened. The trees speak to you in whispers of growth and memory. The animals recognize you as kin.

And when you use magic, it's not just dimensional manipulation—it's [i]life itself[/i] responding to your intentions.

*page_break

Izack creates a new position for you: Guardian of the Living Realm.

You will protect Avalon's ecosystems, maintain the balance between magical and natural growth, and serve as a bridge between dimensional magic and the living world.

*page_break

When you return to Avalon Academy, every lie sounds like discord.

Every truth rings like a bell.

The Truth-Sworn Sand has changed how you perceive reality itself. You can no longer be deceived—not by others, and not by yourself.

*page_break

Aria Ravencrest is waiting for you in the library.

[b]"I heard what happened in the Singing Dunes,"[/b] she says. [b]"The desert tested you, and you answered with honesty. Rare."[/b]

*line_break

She gestures to a shelf of ancient texts.

[b]"These books are filled with truths that most mages refuse to acknowledge. You, ${name}, are one of the few who might be able to bear them."[/b]

*page_break

She begins your true education.

Over the next months, Aria teaches you secrets that would shatter lesser mages—truths about the nature of dimensional magic, about the costs of power, about the lies the magical community tells itself to sleep at night.

*line_break

And you listen. You learn. You [i]understand[/i].

Because you are Truthbound now. Lies hold no power over you.

*page_break

When you return to Avalon Academy, the living runes beneath your skin shimmer with every movement.

You speak a word in the First Tongue, and the air itself [i]responds[/i], reshaping according to the grammar of creation.

*page_break

Izack stares at the runes dancing across your arms.

[b]"The First Tongue,"[/b] he breathes. [b]"Written on your body. You're a Runeweaver, ${name}. Do you understand what that means?"[/b]

*line_break

You nod slowly.

The runes aren't just markings—they're living language, the words that reality speaks to itself.

*page_break

Izack becomes your mentor.

He teaches you how to pronounce the First Tongue correctly, how to combine runes into sentences of power, how to speak creation into being.

*line_break

It's difficult. Dangerous. One mispronounced syllable could shatter dimensional boundaries or collapse pocket realities.

But you learn. Slowly, carefully, you master the language written on your skin.

*page_break

*line_break

You graduate with the title [b]Runeweaver[/b]—one who speaks the First Tongue.

When you write runes in the air, they hang there like frozen commands, waiting to reshape the world.

Instead of simply graduating, you'll stay at Avalon Academy to help advance the understanding of collaborative magic itself.

Over the next months, you work alongside Izack and Aria, researching new applications of collaborative magic.

You discover ways to share magical workload across multiple mages, techniques for harmonizing opposing magical styles, methods for teaching collaboration to stubborn individualists.

The rune doesn't grant you overwhelming power. Instead, it gives you something subtler: the ability to recognize mystery itself.

When others see the unknown, you see [i]possibility[/i].

[b]"You demonstrated no understanding of collaborative magic. You fought against every principle we tried to teach you. You treated power as something to dominate rather than partner with."[/b]

*page_break

The Council votes.

It's unanimous.

*line_break

You are [b]expelled[/b] from Avalon Academy.

*page_break

Polly lands on your shoulder as you pack your belongings.

For once, she has no sarcastic quip. She just looks sad.

[i]"I tried to warn you,"[/i] she says quietly. [i]"Avalon requires collaboration. You can't force your way through dimensional magic. I'm sorry, ${name}."[/i]

*page_break

You leave through the main gates, your magical education incomplete.

The Spiral Spire twists above you, beautiful and impossible—a dream you couldn't achieve.

*page_break

*line_break

[b]== AFTERWARD ==[/b]

*line_break

You try to continue your magical studies elsewhere, but without Avalon's training, progress is slow.

Some expelled students eventually find their way. Others abandon magic entirely.

*line_break

You wonder which path you'll take.

*page_break

*line_break

[b]== YOUR OUTCOME ==[/b]

*line_break

• You were expelled from Avalon Academy
• Your collaboration score was critically low: ${collaboration}
• You failed to understand the core principles of dimensional magic
• Your artifact: ${artifact_earned}

*line_break

[i]You achieved the failure ending. Sometimes, we are not ready for the paths we choose.[/i]

When you return to Avalon Academy, you realize something:

Your journey was... normal.

*page_break

You didn't achieve legendary partnership. You didn't master the First Tongue. You didn't become a Guardian or a Truthbound Mage.

But you [i]did[/i] complete your training. You learned dimensional magic. You passed your expedition.

*line_break

You're an average Avalon graduate. And that's okay.

*page_break

Izack congratulates you with a warm smile.

[b]"Well done, ${name}. You've completed the standard curriculum successfully. You're ready to begin your career as a dimensional mage."[/b]

*line_break

It's not dramatic. There are no speeches about your legendary potential.

But there's satisfaction in knowing you [i]finished[/i] what you started.

*page_break

*line_break

[b]== GRADUATION DAY ==[/b]

*line_break

You graduate alongside dozens of other students.

You receive your certificate, your dimensional focus, and your official license to practice boundary magic.

*line_break

It's a good life ahead of you—not legendary, but solid. Worthwhile.

*page_break

Polly lands on your shoulder as you leave the graduation ceremony.

[i]"So,"[/i] she says, [i]"not a legendary ending. But not a bad one either. You did okay, ${name}. You really did."[/i]

*page_break

*line_break

[b]== YOUR LEGACY ==[/b]

*line_break

• You graduated successfully from Avalon Academy
• You found work as a dimensional mage
• You lived a good, stable life
• Your collaboration score: ${collaboration}
• Your artifact: ${artifact_earned}

*line_break

[i]You achieved the standard ending. Not every story is legendary—and that's perfectly fine.[/i]

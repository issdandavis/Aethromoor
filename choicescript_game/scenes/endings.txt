Izack Thorne himself is waiting in the courtyard.

When he sees you, his eyes widen. He can [i]see[/i] what you've become—the way the glacier's power flows through you, the living runes dancing beneath your skin, the fundamental change in how you interact with dimensional magic.

*line_break

[b]"Impossible,"[/b] he whispers. [b]"You achieved partnership. True, equal partnership with one of the ancient forces. In your first expedition."[/b]

*page_break

He places a hand on your shoulder, and you feel his dimensional awareness brush against yours. For a moment, you sense the vast web of magic he maintains—Avalon itself, alive and growing under his guidance.

[b]"${name}, what you've done... it took me twenty years to achieve. You did it in weeks."[/b]

*line_break

Aria Ravencrest emerges from the library tower, her expression unreadable. She studies you for a long moment.

*page_break

[b]"A Collaborative Master,"[/b] she says quietly. [b]"I've only read about them in the oldest texts. Mages who don't just use magic—they [i]partner[/i] with it. Who treat power as a conversation rather than a tool."[/b]

*line_break

She inclines her head—a gesture of respect from someone who rarely shows it.

[b]"You will surpass us all, ${name}. I am certain of it."[/b]

*page_break

Polly lands on your shoulder, unusually quiet.

After a moment, she speaks—and for once, there's no sarcasm in her voice:

[i]"I've watched Avalon Academy for three hundred years. I've seen thousands of students come and go. And I can count on one wing the number who achieved what you just did."[/i]

You stand in the Hall of Threads—a chamber at the heart of the Spiral Spire where dimensional boundaries are visible as shimmering strands of light.

Today is your graduation.

*page_break

But it's not a normal graduation.

Izack has created a new title for you: [b]Collaborative Master[/b]—the first in generations.

*line_break

You don't just graduate from Avalon Academy. You [i]join[/i] it, becoming one of the legendary mages whose name will be spoken for centuries.

*page_break

The glacier's power flows through you, responding to your thoughts as naturally as breathing. When you gesture, runes write themselves in the air. When you speak, dimensional boundaries [i]listen[/i].

And everywhere you go, you feel it—the living presence of magic itself, partnering with you in ways that make power feel less like control and more like [i]collaboration[/i].

*page_break

Polly perches on the podium as Izack places the silver medallion around your neck.

[i]"Well,"[/i] she says, her eyes bright with pride, [i]"I did say I knew how this story would end. But I'll admit—you surprised even me, ${name}."[/i]

Izack Thorne is waiting in the courtyard, his expression thoughtful.

[b]"You achieved partnership with the glacier,"[/b] he says. [b]"That alone is extraordinary. But I sense... you haven't fully embraced what that means yet."[/b]

*line_break

He's right. You can feel the glacier's power, its presence in your mind—but you're still learning what it means to truly [i]partner[/i] with such an ancient force.

*page_break

[b]"You have time,"[/b] Izack continues. [b]"Partnership is not a destination—it's a journey. You've taken the first step. Now you must learn to walk the path."[/b]

*page_break

Over the next months, you study intensively with Izack.

He teaches you how to deepen your connection with the glacier, how to hear its voice more clearly, how to merge your intentions with its ancient wisdom.

Slowly, you begin to understand what you've been given.

The glacier's presence hums in the back of your mind, constant and reassuring.

You know that in time, as you grow and learn, this partnership will become something extraordinary.

When you return to Avalon Academy, everything feels [i]different[/i].

You can sense every living thing around you—the grass beneath your feet, the trees in the courtyard, even the tiny insects crawling through the soil. All of it connected, all of it alive, all of it part of you now.

*page_break

Zara is waiting for you, her expression shifting to wonder when she sees you.

[b]"You... you bonded with the Heartwood Tree. I can feel it."[/b]

She reaches out, her hand hovering near yours, and you feel her life force like a warm flame.

[b]"You're connected to everything now. Every living thing in Avalon, all at once."[/b]

*page_break

She's right. The golden fruit from the Heartwood Tree didn't just give you power—it made you part of the forest's eternal network.

You are a [b]Guardian[/b] now, bonded to the living world in ways that transcend normal magic.

*page_break

*line_break

[b]== YOUR NEW ROLE ==[/b]

*line_break

You don't simply graduate from Avalon Academy.

Instead, you become its first [b]Heartwood Guardian[/b]—a protector of the living magic that flows through the realm.

*page_break

You can feel when anything in Avalon is hurt or threatened. The trees speak to you in whispers of growth and memory. The animals recognize you as kin.

And when you use magic, it's not just dimensional manipulation—it's [i]life itself[/i] responding to your intentions.

*page_break

Izack creates a new position for you: Guardian of the Living Realm.

You will protect Avalon's ecosystems, maintain the balance between magical and natural growth, and serve as a bridge between dimensional magic and the living world.

When you return to Avalon Academy, every lie sounds like discord.

Every truth rings like a bell.

The Truth-Sworn Sand has changed how you perceive reality itself. You can no longer be deceived—not by others, and not by yourself.

*page_break

Aria Ravencrest is waiting for you in the library.

[b]"I heard what happened in the Singing Dunes,"[/b] she says. [b]"The desert tested you, and you answered with honesty. Rare."[/b]

*line_break

She gestures to a shelf of ancient texts.

[b]"These books are filled with truths that most mages refuse to acknowledge. You, ${name}, are one of the few who might be able to bear them."[/b]

*page_break

She begins your true education.

Over the next months, Aria teaches you secrets that would shatter lesser mages—truths about the nature of dimensional magic, about the costs of power, about the lies the magical community tells itself to sleep at night.

*line_break

And you listen. You learn. You [i]understand[/i].

Because you are Truthbound now. Lies hold no power over you.

When you return to Avalon Academy, the living runes beneath your skin shimmer with every movement.

You speak a word in the First Tongue, and the air itself [i]responds[/i], reshaping according to the grammar of creation.

*page_break

Izack stares at the runes dancing across your arms.

[b]"The First Tongue,"[/b] he breathes. [b]"Written on your body. You're a Runeweaver, ${name}. Do you understand what that means?"[/b]

*line_break

You nod slowly.

The runes aren't just markings—they're living language, the words that reality speaks to itself.

*page_break

Izack becomes your mentor.

He teaches you how to pronounce the First Tongue correctly, how to combine runes into sentences of power, how to speak creation into being.

*line_break

It's difficult. Dangerous. One mispronounced syllable could shatter dimensional boundaries or collapse pocket realities.

But you learn. Slowly, carefully, you master the language written on your skin.

[b]"But you [i]completed[/i] it,"[/b] Izack continues. [b]"You didn't give up. You didn't flee back through the portal. You saw it through to the end, even when it was hard. That counts for something."[/b]

He places a hand on your shoulder.

[b]"You're not ready to be a great mage yet, ${name}. But you have the determination to become one, if you're willing to do the work."[/b]

*page_break

You spend extra months at the Academy, working on your weak points.

Collaboration doesn't come naturally to you. You resist it. But slowly, with patient instruction, you begin to understand why it matters.

[b]== GRADUATION DAY ==[/b]

*line_break

You graduate—barely. Your scores are low, your collaboration skills are still developing, and you know you have a long way to go.

But you [i]graduate[/i].

*line_break

And sometimes, that's enough.

[b]== YOUR LEGACY ==[/b]

*line_break

• You learned that magic requires humility
• Your struggles taught you empathy for other struggling students
• You may yet grow into something greater
• Your collaboration score: ${collaboration}
• Your path: Humbled but Determined

[i]You achieved a difficult ending. Sometimes surviving is its own victory.[/i]

When you return to Avalon Academy, Izack is waiting—along with Aria and the Academy Council.

Their expressions tell you everything you need to know.

*page_break

[b]"${name},"[/b] Izack begins, his voice heavy with disappointment, [b]"your performance during the expedition was... unacceptable."[/b]

*line_break

Aria steps forward, her expression cold.

[b]"You demonstrated no understanding of collaborative magic. You fought against every principle we tried to teach you. You treated power as something to dominate rather than partner with."[/b]

*page_break

The Council votes.

It's unanimous.

*line_break

You are [b]expelled[/b] from Avalon Academy.

Polly lands on your shoulder as you pack your belongings.

For once, she has no sarcastic quip. She just looks sad.

[i]"I tried to warn you,"[/i] she says quietly. [i]"Avalon requires collaboration. You can't force your way through dimensional magic. I'm sorry, ${name}."[/i]

*page_break

You leave through the main gates, your magical education incomplete.

The Spiral Spire twists above you, beautiful and impossible—a dream you couldn't achieve.

[b]== AFTERWARD ==[/b]

*line_break

You try to continue your magical studies elsewhere, but without Avalon's training, progress is slow.

Some expelled students eventually find their way. Others abandon magic entirely.

*line_break

You wonder which path you'll take.

*page_break

*line_break

[b]== YOUR OUTCOME ==[/b]

*line_break

• You were expelled from Avalon Academy
• Your collaboration score was critically low: ${collaboration}
• You failed to understand the core principles of dimensional magic
• Your artifact: ${artifact_earned}

[i]You achieved the failure ending. Sometimes, we are not ready for the paths we choose.[/i]

When you return to Avalon Academy, you realize something:

Your journey was... normal.

*page_break

You didn't achieve legendary partnership. You didn't master the First Tongue. You didn't become a Guardian or a Truthbound Mage.

But you [i]did[/i] complete your training. You learned dimensional magic. You passed your expedition.

*line_break

You're an average Avalon graduate. And that's okay.

*page_break

Izack congratulates you with a warm smile.

[b]"Well done, ${name}. You've completed the standard curriculum successfully. You're ready to begin your career as a dimensional mage."[/b]

*line_break

It's not dramatic. There are no speeches about your legendary potential.

But there's satisfaction in knowing you [i]finished[/i] what you started.

*page_break

[b]== GRADUATION DAY ==[/b]

*line_break

You graduate alongside dozens of other students.

You receive your certificate, your dimensional focus, and your official license to practice boundary magic.

*line_break

It's a good life ahead of you—not legendary, but solid. Worthwhile.

*page_break

Polly lands on your shoulder as you leave the graduation ceremony.

[i]"So,"[/i] she says, [i]"not a legendary ending. But not a bad one either. You did okay, ${name}. You really did."[/i]

*page_break

*line_break

[b]== YOUR LEGACY ==[/b]

*line_break

• You graduated successfully from Avalon Academy
• You found work as a dimensional mage
• You lived a good, stable life
• Your collaboration score: ${collaboration}
• Your artifact: ${artifact_earned}

*line_break

[i]You achieved the standard ending. Not every story is legendary—and that's perfectly fine.[/i]

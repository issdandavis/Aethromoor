After settling into Avalon Academy, you're called to the Familiar Bonding Chamber—a circular room where leylines converge in shimmering patterns.

*page_break

Izack stands at the center, surrounded by various magical creatures, each one a potential familiar.

[b]"Every mage at Avalon bonds with a familiar,"[/b] he explains. [b]"These aren't pets or servants—they're partners. Equals. Your familiar will grow with you, learn with you, and sometimes know you better than you know yourself."[/b]

*line_break

*page_break

You can already feel Polly's presence—she's been with you since arrival, her sarcastic commentary a constant companion.

But Polly is... unusual. She's bonded to Avalon itself, an ancient dimensional anchor. She can narrate multiple students' stories simultaneously.

*page_break

Polly lands on your shoulder.

[i]"Right. Decision time, ${name}. I can be your familiar if you want—I'm already invested in your story. But fair warning: I come with three hundred years of sarcasm and a tendency to spoil plot points."[/i]

*line_break

[i]"Or you can bond with one of the other familiars here. Each has unique gifts. Choose wisely."[/i]

*page_break

*label familiar_choice_menu

Izack gestures to the assembled creatures:

You extend your hand to Polly.

"I choose you. You've been with me from the beginning. Let's make it official."

*line_break

For once, Polly is speechless.

*page_break

She hops onto your extended hand, her metallic feathers shimmering with runic patterns.

[i]"Well,"[/i] she finally says, her voice softer than usual. [i]"That's... unexpected. And touching. Which is annoying because I was going for cynical detachment."[/i]

*line_break

Izack smiles.

[b]"Polly rarely bonds with individual students. You should feel honored."[/b]

*page_break

The leylines in the chamber pulse, and you feel the bond form—not a binding, but a [i]connection[/i]. Polly's ancient consciousness brushes against yours, sharing fragments of three centuries of memory.

*line_break

[i]"There,"[/i] Polly says. [i]"Now you're stuck with me. And I'm stuck with you. Let's try not to die embarrassingly, shall we?"[/i]

${familiar_name} is... difficult to describe. ${He_She} exists in the space between dimensions—sometimes visible as a shimmer of impossible colors, sometimes just a sense of presence.

The Great Hall hums with gentle anticipation as students file toward a circular dais inscribed with Kor'aelin runes.  
At the center rests a pedestal carved of living wood and stone, its surface shimmering with a light that seems to be listening.  

Izack raises his hands and the murmurs fall silent.  

"Avalon believes no one should walk the spiral alone," he says. "Your familiar will be your partner, confidant, and sometimes conscience.  
You won't bind them. You will invite them, and if they accept, you will grow together."

Polly lands on the pedestal, fluffing her feathers.  
"They all have opinions," she adds. "If you pick me, you get unparalleled guidance and wit. If you don't, well... I'll still be around. Probably."

The pedestal flares as five forms coalesce:  
— A raven formed of midnight ink and starlight, watching you with knowing eyes.  
— A small clay figure kneading itself into different shapes, its surface etched with Runethic spirals.  
— A miniature dragonling of shimmering scales and smoke, its wings beating in time with your heartbeat.  
— A spriteswarm of glowing runes, each symbol flickering like a Cassisivadan rhyme.  
— A dancing flame with bright eyes, crackling with warmth and boundless energy.

        The raven tilts her head. "Of course you would pick the most charming and knowledgeable option," she says.
        She hops onto your arm and preens. "Excellent choice, dear. Now I'll have to add 'familiar' to my business cards."

        You kneel and place your hands on the clay. It pulses under your touch, responding to your invitation.  
        In Kor'aelin, you whisper, *Sil'nav vel'ra* — "Flow of diversity, invitation."  
        The clay warms, then begins to knead itself into a form that matches your intentions.

                The golem's eyes glow softly as it looks up at you.  
                It nudges your hand with surprising warmth.  
                "I will watch over you," it seems to say without words.

                The clay ripples into a streamlined shape, its limbs ending in delicate fingers perfect for tinkering.  
                "Adventure?" it inquires without sound.

                The clay cycles through faces and forms, a living sculpture of possibility.  
                It giggles—an echo of Cassisivadan tones.  
                "We are what we need to be," you hear, though no mouth moves.

        The dragonling sniffs the air around you and emits a soft chirp.  
        You kneel, and it bumps its head against your chest.  
        Zara, watching from the sidelines, smiles approvingly. "They're young, but they'll learn fast," she says.

                The sprites align into a circular ring of glyphs spelling "med'nav" — wisdom and diversity.

                The sprites swirl into a helix, forming a Cassisivadan circuit.

Polly flutters overhead, whether she's your familiar or not. "And your dorm will now be 83% more chaotic. Enjoy."

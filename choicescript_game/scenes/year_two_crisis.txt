Fissures of impossible darkness spider across its trunk. Where they spread, reality itself seems to *thin*. You can see through the cracks to somewhere else—somewhere *wrong*. Empty space that hungers.

The branches overhead, usually laden with impossible fruit, are withering. Dimensional instabilities ripple through the air like heat waves.

You examine the dimensional tears alongside Aria, your months of research training focusing your perception.

  The pattern is *almost* familiar. Something from your studies, but you can't quite grasp it. The urgency makes it hard to think clearly.

The dimensional instabilities manifest as tears in reality itself. Through them, you glimpse the *void*—empty space between dimensions that hungers to consume.

Your combat training kicks in. While the others analyze, you [i]act[/i].

*page_break

He gestures to the gathered crowd—students, faculty, all of Avalon's community.

*line_break

[b]"We could perform a mass collaborative ritual. Every person here, linking their magic together, channeling power into the World Tree to stabilize the dimensional anchor. It would be the largest collaborative working ever attempted."[/b]

*page_break

*if collaboration >= 70
  The idea resonates with you immediately. This is exactly what you've trained for—what Avalon represents.
*else
  The scale of that collaboration seems almost impossible. So many people, so much that could go wrong.

*line_break

Aria speaks up, her voice carefully neutral. [b]"The risk: if collaboration fails—if people panic, if the connection breaks—the feedback could kill everyone involved. We'd need [i]perfect[/i] harmony under extreme pressure."[/b]

*page_break

[b]"The second option,"[/b] Aria continues, [b]"is more reliable but... costly."[/b]

*line_break

She traces patterns in the air, showing complex boundary seal formations.

*page_break

[b]"I could seal the tears using high-level boundary magic. Create an artificial dimensional membrane around the failing anchor. It would be stable, certain, and safe."[/b]

*line_break

[b]"But?"[/b] Zara prompts, sensing the hesitation.

*page_break

Aria's jaw tightens. [b]"But it requires sacrificing some of Avalon's core principles. The seals would be... rigid. Permanent. They'd stabilize the dimension by *restricting* it. No more easy travel between realms. No more open doors. Avalon would become more like a prison than a bridge between worlds."[/b]

*line_break

Izack's pain is visible. Everything he built Avalon to be, compromised for survival.

*page_break

Zara steps forward. [b]"There's a third option. One you haven't mentioned yet."[/b]

*line_break

She looks at you directly. [b]"What if we don't choose between collaboration and boundaries? What if we [i]combine[/i] them?"[/b]

*page_break

Aria's eyes widen. [b]"That's... theoretically possible. Use collaborative magic to strengthen Avalon's core while simultaneously using boundary magic to reinforce the damaged areas. The best of both approaches."[/b]

*line_break

Izack nods slowly. [b]"But exponentially more difficult. It would require someone who understands [i]both[/i] paradigms deeply—someone who could coordinate massive collaboration while simultaneously performing master-level boundary work. And the margin for error would be..."[/b]

The World Tree bears visible scars. The dimensional stability is lower than before. But you're alive. The academy survives.

But everyone can feel the difference. The academy feels... constrained. Smaller. The easy flow between dimensions is gone, replaced by rigid controlled passages.

Aria stands alone near the World Tree, staring at her handiwork. The seals pulse with steady, unyielding light.

You've returned from your expedition changed.

*if artifact_earned = "Truth-Sworn Sand"
  The desert's truth still echoes in your thoughts.

*if artifact_earned = "Heartwood Guardian - Ancient Wisdom"
  You feel every living thing in Avalon as if they're part of you.

Everyone who went on expeditions came back different.

Some are quieter, more thoughtful. Others are more confident. A few seem shaken but determined.

*page_break

Classes continue, but there's a shift.

The masters treat you less like students and more like emerging mages. You've proven yourselves in the field.

*page_break

Tonight, there's no formal training.

Instead, you have free time—rare in Avalon's intensive program. You can spend it deepening your connection with someone who matters.

You find Izack on the observation deck at the top of the Spiral Spire.

He's sitting on the edge, legs dangling over a drop that would terrify most people, casually eating an apple while watching dimensional currents swirl through the sky.

*page_break

[b]"Hey, ${name}!"[/b] He pats the space beside him. [b]"Join me?"[/b]

You sit carefully, trying not to look down.

[b]"Don't worry—there's a dimensional cushion below. If you fall, you'll just float gently back up. Probably."[/b]

*line_break

He grins at your expression.

[b]"I'm kidding. Definitely. There's definitely a safety net."[/b]

*page_break

You sit together in companionable silence for a moment.

*if collaboration <= 70
  [b]"You're learning. Growing. That's what matters."[/b]

He tosses his apple core off the spire.

Instead of falling, it dissolves into dimensional energy and disperses as golden light.

    [b]"I created Avalon,"[/b] he begins, [b]"because I was tired of seeing magic treated as individual power. Mages hoarding knowledge, competing instead of collaborating, treating magic like a weapon or a tool."[/b]

    *line_break

    He gestures to the dimension around you—the Spiral Spire, the World Tree, the pocket realms.

    *page_break

    [b]"This place is my argument. My [i]proof[/i] that magic works better as collaboration. That dimensional power isn't about control—it's about relationship."[/b]

    *line_break

    He looks at you seriously.

    You sit with that for a moment.

    Then you ask: "Do you ever doubt? Ever wonder if you're wrong about collaboration?"

    *line_break

    He laughs.

    [b]"Every day. That's how I know I'm on the right path—I keep questioning it, testing it, proving it. Certainty is the enemy of growth."[/b]

    *page_break

    He stands, offering you a hand up.

    [b]"Come on. I want to show you something."[/b]

    *line_break

    He leads you to a viewing panel where you can see all of Avalon at once—every pocket dimension, every student, every magical current.

    [b]"This is what collaboration looks like when it scales. Hundreds of mages, thousands of spells, all working together as one living system."[/b]

    *page_break

    [b]"Someday, ${name}, you might create something like this too. Not a copy of Avalon, but your own vision of what collaborative magic can be."[/b]

    *line_break

    He smiles wryly.

    [b]"But I kept believing. And eventually, Avalon [i]answered[/i]. It wanted to exist. It wanted to grow."[/b]

    *page_break

    [b]"Teaching students like you makes it worth it. Every time someone 'gets' collaboration, every time someone achieves partnership with magic instead of domination... that's why I do this."[/b]

    You thank him for sharing.

    He grins.

You find Aria in the restricted section of the library.

She's surrounded by floating books, each one open to a different page, creating a three-dimensional web of interconnected knowledge.

*page_break

She glances up when you enter.

[b]"${name}. Come. I'm working on something that might interest you."[/b]

You approach carefully, not wanting to disturb her complex arrangement.

*page_break

[b]"I'm mapping the theoretical connections between all recorded collaborative magic breakthroughs in the past five centuries."[/b]

She waves a hand, and the books rearrange, showing a pattern.

    After several minutes, you see it.

    "Every breakthrough involved accepting help. Or asking questions. Or admitting limitations."

    *line_break

    Aria's expression shifts—almost a smile.

    [b]"Exactly. [i]Exactly[/i]."[/b]

    *page_break

    She pulls out a chair for you.

    [b]"Most people see collaborative magic as a technique. A method. But it's deeper than that—it's an [i]epistemology[/i]. A way of knowing."[/b]

    *line_break

    She gestures to the books.

    [b]"Individual mages hit ceilings. Their own limits become invisible walls. But collaborative mages? They can see past their own blind spots because others show them what they can't see alone."[/b]

    *page_break

    *if class_focus = "theory"

      [b]"The desert marked you truthbound. That's rare. Truth requires seeing past your own biases. Collaboration requires the same skill."[/b]

    She pulls out an ancient text.

    [b]"Here. This is from the First Mages. Most students aren't ready for it. But you are."[/b]

    You spend the next hour reading together, discussing, debating. Aria treats you like an intellectual equal—challenging your ideas, but respecting your reasoning.

    When you finally leave, she says:

    Aria nods, seeming pleased rather than disappointed.

    [b]"Good. Better to admit you don't know than to guess blindly."[/b]

    *page_break

    She rearranges the books into a clearer pattern.

    [b]"Every major breakthrough in collaborative magic came from someone who admitted they didn't know something. Who asked for help. Who recognized their own limitations."[/b]

    *line_break

    She looks at you directly.

    [b]"You just demonstrated that principle. Many students would have tried to bluff. You were honest."[/b]

    *page_break

    [b]"Intellectual honesty is rarer than you'd think,"[/b] she continues. [b]"And it's essential for true learning."[/b]

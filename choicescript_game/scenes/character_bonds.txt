*label bond_izack
You track down Izack in one of the side towers, where he is attempting to coax a staircase into staying in one place.  
He notices you and smiles nervously, chalk dust smudged across his cheek.

"Ah, ${name}!" he says. "Excellent! Maybe you can help me convince this staircase that floors go *up* and *down*, not *east* and *west*."

*choice
    #Offer to help with the negotiation.
        *set izack_relationship +3
        *set collaboration +2
        *set magic_control +1
        You whisper to the staircase in Kor'aelin, inviting it to rest in one orientation. The air chills, mint fills your mouth, and the stairs grudgingly align.  
        "Brilliant!" Izack exclaims. "See? It likes you! Or it likes your pronunciation. Either way, I'm grateful."  
        *goto izack_chat
    #Ask Izack how he ended up building Avalon.
        *set izack_relationship +2
        "Long story short? Aria told me my coffee table idea was impractical and I took it as a challenge," he jokes.  
        Then he becomes serious. "I wanted a place where people like me—people who asked too many questions—could belong. I didn't have that growing up."  
        *goto izack_chat
    #Invite him to get tea and take a break from work.
        *set izack_relationship +3
        *set empathy +2
        Izack looks longingly at the teapot on his desk. "Oh stars, yes," he sighs. "If this staircase is going to wander, it can do it without me for fifteen minutes."  
        *goto izack_chat

*label izack_chat
You and Izack chat for a while about everything from the ethics of dimensional tweaking to his favorite pastry (almond swirls).  
At one point, he confesses, "Sometimes I still feel like that kid who accidentally summoned a coffee table into his parents' living room. The difference is now I'm allowed to break things on purpose."  
His laughter is self-deprecating and warm.  
Polly, perched nearby, comments, "He still summons coffee tables when he's nervous."

*label bond_aria
You find Aria in the boundary lab, where delicate sigils float in mid-air. Her hair is pulled back, her focus absolute.

She notices you and smiles. "Looking for a distraction or a demonstration?" she asks.

*choice
    #Ask her about her passion for boundary magic.
        *set aria_relationship +3
        *set academics +1
        "I grew up in a place where boundaries were enforced brutally," she says quietly. "I learned early that walls can protect and imprison. I wanted to build better ones—ones you could open if you knew how."  
        She traces a sigil in the air, and a shimmering doorway appears momentarily.  
        *goto aria_chat
    #Request a lesson in precise sigil work.
        *set aria_relationship +2
        *set magic_control +3
        Aria demonstrates how to draw a perfect circle in the air without letting your hand shake. "It's all in the breath," she says. You follow her lead, the act meditative and satisfying.  
        *goto aria_chat
    #Invite her to share stories over lunch.
        *set aria_relationship +3
        *set social +2
        Over roasted vegetable wraps, Aria tells you about her first time successfully weaving a boundary and how she nearly fainted from joy.  
        "They didn't let me do any more for a week," she laughs. "They were worried I'd collapse a wall."  
        *goto aria_chat

*label aria_chat
After your time together, Aria looks thoughtful. "Thank you," she says. "I don't often talk about myself. Boundaries, you know."  
She offers you a small piece of chalk laced with boundary sigils. "For emergencies," she says. "It holds things together."

*label bond_zara
You locate Zara in the greenhouse, her fingers buried in soil as she sings softly in a language you don't recognize. The plants seem to lean toward her voice.  
She looks up when you arrive and flashes a grin, scales glinting in the light.

*choice
    #Compliment her singing and ask what language it is.
        *set zara_relationship +3
        *set empathy +1
        "It's Ur'aelin," she says. "Fragments of the Proto-Spiral. My grandma taught me what she knew. It's mostly lullabies and curse words."  
        She sings a few more lines; the air tastes like starfruit.  
        *goto zara_chat
    #Ask to help with the plants.
        *set zara_relationship +2
        *set guild_elementalist +1
        You kneel beside her and carefully tend to the seedlings. As you work, Zara tells you about her dream to cultivate a garden that exists in multiple realities at once.  
        *goto zara_chat
    #Invite her to spar—amicable dragon-style.
        *set zara_relationship +3
        *set power +2
        Zara's eyes gleam. "Don't worry, I won't burn down the greenhouse," she promises.  
        You spar gently in a training ring conjured by Izack, and though you lose, you learn to anticipate her tail swipes.  
        *goto zara_chat

*label zara_chat
Zara eventually sits cross-legged and sips from a bottle of shimmering liquid. "Being part dragon isn't just breath weapons," she says. "It's expectations. People think I'm always strong. Sometimes I'm tired too."  
You feel closer to her for her honesty.  
*finish

*label bond_rupert
You find Rupert in the library, reading a thick tome with a look of intense concentration. His enchanted suitcase hovers nearby, tidying up stray books.

"Oh, it's you," he says, marking his place. "Care to judge me for being industrious?" There's a smile hiding under the sarcasm.

*choice
    #Ask how he's adjusting to Avalon life.
        *set rupert_relationship +3
        "It's... humbling," he admits. "I went from commanding armies to being told to carry my own books. It's good for me, I suppose. Don't tell anyone I said that."  
        *goto rupert_chat
    #Challenge him to a game of magical chess.
        *set rupert_relationship +2
        *set academics +2
        The enchanted chess board conjures creatures instead of pieces. Your knights are little clay golems. Rupert's bishop quotes poetry as it moves.  
        He beats you on the last move, but only because Polly keeps distracting you.  
        *goto rupert_chat
    #Compliment his dueling coat and ask about his past duels.
        *set rupert_relationship +3
        *set social +1
        He straightens his coat. "I once dueled a sorcerer who tried to cheat by summoning a swarm of bees," he says. "It was... sticky."  
        He laughs at the memory. "I won, but I still can't stand honey."  
        *goto rupert_chat

*label rupert_chat
Rupert's sarcastic veneer slips occasionally, revealing a thoughtful, earnest core.  
"My parents named me after a hero," he confesses. "Do you have any idea how exhausting that is?"  
He closes his book with a sigh. "I'm trying to figure out who I am if I'm not trying to live up to someone else."  
You nod; you understand.  
*finish

*label bond_polly
You find Polly perched on the top shelf of the library, annotating a book with her beak.  
"Finally," she says. "Someone to appreciate my wit without being obligated to feed me."

*choice
    #Ask Polly about her favorite gossip.
        *set polly_relationship +3
        "Did you know Aria talks in her sleep? It's adorable," she whispers conspiratorially. "Also, the World Tree has opinions about the new courtyard fountain. It wanted a statue of itself. Narcissistic, if you ask me."  
        *goto polly_chat
    #Ask Polly to teach you a Kor'aelin phrase.
        *set polly_relationship +2
        *set collaboration +2
        "How about *thul'joy sil'play*?" she suggests. "It means 'spiral joy together play.' Also works as a distraction if you yell it during a duel."  
        *goto polly_chat
    #Invite Polly to watch the sunset with you.
        *set polly_relationship +3
        *set philosophical_depth +2
        You both sit on the edge of the Spire as the sun dips below the horizon. Polly is quiet for once.  
        "The Spiral is beautiful," she finally says. "I forget sometimes. People keep me busy."  
        *goto polly_chat

*label polly_chat
Polly preens contentedly and then fixes you with one black eye.  
"Everyone thinks I'm just a snark dispenser," she says. "But I'm a snark dispenser with depth."  
You both laugh. For a moment, the world feels simple.

*comment Bond with the clay familiar if chosen.  
You sit with your clay companion in a quiet courtyard. It shapes itself into a smaller version of you, then into a bird, then back into a lump with a smiling face.  
Its eyes glow gently as it awaits your attention.

*choice
    #Tell it about your day and encourage it to share.
        *set clay_bond +4
        *set empathy +2
        The clay ripples with images and emotions. You see flashes of how it perceived your day: colors when you listened to Aria, warmth when Zara smiled at you, frustration during lectures.  
        It radiates affection toward you.  
        *goto clay_chat
    #Teach it a new shape by sculpting together.
        *set clay_bond +3
        *set creativity +3
        Together, you coax the clay into forming an intricate spiral lizard. It giggles (somehow) and then shapes itself into the same.  
        *goto clay_chat
    #Ask it about its origin—how it came to you.
        *set clay_bond +2
        The clay shivers and then projects a memory: you on a beach, alone and crying. A piece of driftwood and sand forming Clay in your hands.  
        You feel the same mix of need and wonder that created your familiar.  
        *set has_understood_clay_origin true
        *goto clay_chat

*label clay_chat
Clay presses into your hand, its warmth and solidity a comfort. You realize that while it is an extension of you, it is also its own consciousness in the making.  
Polly lands nearby. "Fascinating thing, creation through need," she muses. "It always leaves me feeling... hopeful."

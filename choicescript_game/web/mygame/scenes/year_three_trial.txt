[b]== THE YEAR THREE TRIAL: PROVING MASTERY ==[/b]

*line_break

The Mastery Year draws to a close.

*page_break

Three years ago, you arrived at Avalon Academy as a nervous first-year, uncertain of your abilities, overwhelmed by the impossible architecture and dimensional magic that permeated every stone.

Two years ago, you faced your first real crisis and proved you could survive.

One year ago, you defended your competency in your chosen path.

*line_break

Today, you prove mastery.

*page_break

The Hall of Threads has been transformed. Where previous trials were conducted in separate chambers, today all three paths converge in a single vast space. The entire faculty stands witness—Izack, Aria, Zara, and dozens of other instructors you've learned from over the years.

Every second-year student watches from elevated galleries. Every first-year peers down with wide eyes, wondering if they'll ever reach this level.

*page_break

Headmistress Valeris stands at the center, her silver hair catching the light from a hundred dimensional currents.

[b]"Third-year students,"[/b] she announces, her voice carrying to every corner. [b]"You stand at the threshold between student and graduate. Between learning and practicing. Between potential and achievement."[/b]

*line_break

She gestures, and the floor of the hall transforms into a shimmering map of Avalon and the surrounding dimensional landscape.

*page_break

[b]"Your final assessment is not a simulation. Not a controlled environment. You will demonstrate your mastery by performing actual service to Avalon Academy and the realms we protect."[/b]

Three markers appear on the map, each pulsing with different energy.

The Continental Magical Symposium materializes around you—a grand amphitheater constructed from pure collaborative magic, connecting seven different realms simultaneously.

Hundreds of scholars, researchers, and magical theorists from across dimensions fill the seats. Their collective knowledge is staggering, intimidating, and exhilarating.

*page_break

You stand at the presentation podium. Behind you, magical projections wait to display your research. Three years of study, experimentation, and theoretical breakthrough distilled into this moment.

Aria sits in the front row, her expression carefully neutral, but you can see the tension in her shoulders. Your success reflects on her mentorship.

The dimensional portal deposits you and your team in the Shattered Wastes—a devastated region where reality itself has fractured from centuries of magical warfare.

The sky flickers between three different times of day simultaneously. Gravity shifts unpredictably. And somewhere ahead, hostile dimensional entities are pouring through an unstable rift.

Your team consists of two second-year combat students and one first-year who's shown exceptional promise. They look to you for leadership.

This is what command feels like.

        You take time to analyze the rift, the entity patterns, the environmental hazards. Three years of training has taught you that rushing in gets people killed.

        You identify the rift's anchor points, plot an approach that uses terrain to your advantage, and establish clear fallback positions.

The battle is brutal and chaotic.

Dimensional entities—creatures of pure unstable magic—swarm from the rift. They phase in and out of reality, making them difficult to target. The environment itself works against you as gravity shifts and spatial dimensions warp.

*page_break

    But you're ready for this. Three years of combat training under Zara has prepared you for exactly this kind of nightmare scenario.

    Your combat magic is precise and devastating. You adapt to each spatial shift, counter every entity's unique properties, and keep your team positioned safely.

    *page_break

    When the first-year student gets overwhelmed by three entities at once, you're there—shielding spell deployed instantly, counterattack perfectly timed.

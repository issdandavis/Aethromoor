[i]Ah, nobility. Let me guess—your family expects you to bring honor to the [insert family name here], maintain traditions, and preferably not embarrass anyone at formal dinners.[/i]

*line_break

You come from House ${name}—well, your family name, at least. Magical nobility. Wealth, status, and all the pressure that comes with it.

*page_break

Your family sent you to Avalon with:
[b]• A generous allowance (Wealth +30)[/b]
[b]• Connections to influential mages (Aria +10, Fame +10)[/b]
[b]• High expectations (Stress +15)[/b]

*line_break

Izack Thorne isn't particularly impressed by noble pedigree. He cares about collaboration, not bloodlines. But Aria Ravencrest—former politician, now boundary mage—appreciates someone who understands social structures.

*page_break

[i]"Try not to let the family expectations crush you. I've seen it happen. Repeatedly."[/i]

*label prodigy_origin

[i]Self-taught! Oh, this will be interesting. You probably have some very creative interpretations of magical theory. Some will be brilliant. Some will be dangerously wrong.[/i]

*line_break

You weren't born into magic. You discovered it.

Maybe it was an accident—a moment of intense emotion that broke reality. Maybe you read forbidden texts and experimented in secret. However it happened, you taught yourself the basics before anyone knew you had the gift.

*page_break

Your self-teaching has given you:
[b]• Raw power from experimentation (Power +15)[/b]
[b]• Unconventional knowledge (Knowledge +10, Innovation +20)[/b]
[b]• Difficulty with collaboration (Collaboration -10)[/b]

*line_break

You're used to working alone. Figuring things out yourself. Avalon's collaborative approach might challenge everything you know.

*page_break

[i]"Fair warning: unlearning bad habits is harder than learning good ones from scratch. But at least you'll bring fresh perspectives."[/i]

*comment ================================================

*label lineage_origin

[i]Magical lineage. So magic runs in your family—passed down through generations like a particularly complicated heirloom.[/i]

*line_break

You grew up surrounded by magic.

Your parents (or grandparents, or great-aunt Millicent) practiced dimensional magic, boundary work, or ancient traditions. You learned theory at the dinner table. Practiced basic spells before you could write your own name.

*page_break

Your magical upbringing has given you:
[b]• Strong foundational knowledge (Knowledge +15)[/b]
[b]• Early dimensional magic training (Dimensional Magic +10)[/b]
[b]• Family pressure to excel (Stress +10)[/b]

*line_break

You're not starting from scratch. But Avalon will push you beyond what your family taught—into collaborative magic they might not understand.

*page_break

[i]"Just remember: your family's way isn't the only way. Izack literally invented new forms of magic by ignoring tradition."[/i]

*goto entrance_choice

*label late_bloomer_origin

[i]Late bloomer! So you discovered magic later than the prodigies. That's actually not a disadvantage—you have life experience they lack.[/i]

*line_break

You discovered your magical potential recently.

Maybe you were fifteen, twenty, even thirty before the first spell manifested. While others trained from childhood, you lived a non-magical life—experiencing the world without power, learning empathy, understanding people.

*page_break

Your late start has given you:
[b]• Deep empathy from lived experience (Empathy +20)[/b]
[b]• Natural collaborative instincts (Collaboration +15)[/b]
[b]• Less raw power (Power -10)[/b]
[b]• Appreciation for your opportunity (Happiness +10)[/b]

*line_break

You might not be the strongest mage at Avalon. But you understand people—their fears, hopes, motivations. That's a rare gift among mages who grew up with power.

*page_break

[i]"Some of the best mages I've known were late bloomers. They have perspective the prodigies lack."[/i]

*label refugee_origin

[i]Dimensional refugee. You're not from here—not from this realm. That makes you rare, valuable, and probably carrying trauma you haven't processed yet.[/i]

*line_break

You're from somewhere else.

Another dimension, another reality. Maybe it was peaceful and you left by choice. Maybe it was destroyed and Avalon offered sanctuary. Either way, you're far from home, trying to build a new life in an unfamiliar reality.

*page_break

Your refugee status has given you:
[b]• Unique perspective on dimensions (Innovation +25)[/b]
[b]• Deep empathy for the displaced (Empathy +15)[/b]
[b]• Izack's personal attention (Izack +15)[/b]
[b]• Limited resources (Wealth -20)[/b]

*line_break

Izack Thorne created Avalon as a haven for those who don't fit elsewhere. Refugees, hybrids, outcasts. You're exactly the kind of student he most wants to help.

*page_break

[i]"Welcome to Avalon. You're safe here. Izack will make sure of that."[/i]

*label commoner_origin

[i]Commoner scholar. You earned your place through merit—which means you worked twice as hard as the nobles for half the recognition. I respect that.[/i]

*line_break

You're not from a magical family. No inherited power, no family traditions, no connections.

You earned admission to Avalon through aptitude tests, scholarship competitions, and sheer determination. You're here because you're [i]good enough[/i]—not because of who your parents are.

*page_break

Your commoner background has given you:
[b]• Well-rounded abilities (Knowledge +10, Empathy +10, Collaboration +10)[/b]
[b]• Drive to prove yourself[/b]
[b]• Limited funds (Gold -50)[/b]

*line_break

Some noble students might look down on you. Let them. You'll outwork them.

[i]"Izack was a commoner too. He literally created a new dimension through merit alone. You're in good company."[/i]

Now, ${name}—let's talk about your arrival at Avalon.

*line_break

You stand at the edge of the academy, watching the impossible Spiral Spire twist upward into clouds that shimmer with leyline energy. The World Tree's branches arc overhead, and you can [i]feel[/i] the convergence of magical currents thrumming through the air.

*page_break

Through the crystalline gates ahead, you can see the courtyard. Izack himself is waiting to meet the new arrivals.

*line_break

So, ${name}. How do you want to make your entrance?

  #Approach respectfully and introduce yourself properly.
    *set intro_choice "polite"

[b]== THE FINAL TRIAL ==[/b]

*line_break

Three months have passed since you first arrived at Avalon Academy.

You've completed your expedition. You've deepened your bonds with mentors and fellow students. You've learned theory, practiced application, and discovered what kind of mage you're becoming.

*page_break

Now comes the final test.

*page_break

All first-years gather in the Hall of Threads.

Izack, Aria, and Zara stand before you, their expressions serious.

*page_break

[b]"The final trial,"[/b] Izack begins, [b]"is not like your expedition. This time, you won't face a carefully designed challenge in a controlled environment."[/b]

*line_break

Aria continues:

[b]"This time, you'll face an actual crisis. Something real, immediate, and dangerous."[/b]

*page_break

Zara finishes:

[b]"We've identified dimensional instabilities throughout Avalon—minor tears in the fabric of the pocket dimension. Normally, we'd handle these ourselves. But you're ready to try."[/b]

*line_break

A holographic map appears, showing dozens of flickering points of instability scattered across Avalon.

*page_break

Izack gestures to the map.

[b]"You'll work in teams of three. Each team will be assigned an instability to repair. Success means you graduate. Failure means..."[/b]

*line_break

He doesn't finish, but the implication is clear.

*page_break

The teams are called out.

You're assigned to work with two other students and given your target:

*line_break

A dimensional tear near the World Tree's roots—one of the most critical structures in all of Avalon.

*page_break

Polly lands on your shoulder as you prepare.

[i]"Well. This is it. The final exam. No pressure—only the structural integrity of the dimension we're all living in depends on your success."[/i]

*line_break

[i]"Good luck with that."[/i]

*page_break

*label team_formation

Your team consists of:

*if training_partner = "lyra"
  **Lyra**, your practice partner—precise, methodical, excellent with details.
  *set collaboration +5

*if training_partner = "kade"
  **Kade**, your practice partner—enthusiastic, ambitious, sometimes reckless.
  *set collaboration +5

*if training_partner = "selene"
  **Selene**, your practice partner—talented, competitive, but learning to collaborate.
  *set collaboration +5

And **Marcus**, the second-year student who helped you on your first day—experienced but still learning.

*page_break

Marcus looks nervous.

[b]"Okay,"[/b] he says. [b]"I've done this once before. The key is to work together—no one can stabilize a major tear alone."[/b]

*line_break

*if training_partner = "lyra"
  Lyra nods, already analyzing the data they've been given.

  [b]"The tear is approximately three meters wide. Multiple boundary threads damaged. We'll need coordinated repair."[/b]

*if training_partner = "kade"
  Kade bounces with nervous energy.

  [b]"So we all work together, right? Pool our magic, fix the tear, save the day?"[/b]

*if training_partner = "selene"
  Selene studies the holographic map critically.

  [b]"Three meters wide. That's bigger than the practice tears we've worked with. This will be challenging."[/b]

*page_break

You arrive at the World Tree's roots.

The dimensional tear is immediately visible—a ragged gap in reality itself, crackling with unstable energy. Through it, you can see the [i]nothing[/i] between dimensions—a void that shouldn't exist.

*line_break

It's growing.

*page_break

Marcus swears softly.

[b]"It's worse than the reports said. If this tears completely, it could destabilize the entire Tree network."[/b]

*line_break

*if training_partner = "lyra"
  Lyra's hands shake slightly, but her voice is steady.

  [b]"Then we fix it. Now. Before it gets worse."[/b]

*if training_partner = "kade"
  Kade takes a deep breath.

  [b]"Okay. Okay. We can do this. We [i]have[/i] to do this."[/b]

*if training_partner = "selene"
  Selene's competitive edge sharpens into determination.

  [b]"Failure isn't an option. Let's work."[/b]

*page_break

You need to make a decision about how to approach this:

*page_break

*choice
  #Take charge and coordinate everyone—someone needs to lead.
    *set trial_approach "leadership"
    *set collaboration +5

    "Listen," you say firmly. "We need coordination. Marcus, you're experienced—tell us what you know. Lyra, analyze the tear's structure. Kade, start channeling stabilization energy. I'll coordinate and fill gaps."

    *if training_partner != "lyra"
      "Lyra" should be your partner's name
      *goto coordination_leadership

    *goto coordination_leadership

  #Suggest working as equals—pool knowledge and make decisions together.
    *set trial_approach "collaborative"

    "We're all in this together," you say. "No leaders, no followers. Let's each contribute what we're good at and make decisions collectively."

    *line_break

    Everyone nods.

    *if class_focus = "theory"
      "I can analyze the theoretical structure."

    *if class_focus = "practical"
      "I can sense the dimensional currents and stabilize by feel."

    *if class_focus = "living_magic"
      "I can work with the World Tree's life force to support the repair."

    *page_break

    Marcus adds his experience. Your partner contributes their skills. Together, you form a complete picture.

    *goto collaborative_approach

  #Let Marcus lead since he's more experienced—support his decisions.
    *set trial_approach "supportive"
    *set collaboration +10

    "Marcus," you say, "you've done this before. Tell us what to do."

    *line_break

    He looks surprised, then grateful.

    [b]"Okay. Alright. Um..."[/b]

    *page_break

    He takes a breath, centering himself.

    [b]"Right. We need three mages holding dimensional threads while the fourth weaves the repair. I'll coordinate. ${name}, you—"[/b]

*comment LEADERSHIP APPROACH
*comment ================================================

*label coordination_leadership

You coordinate the effort, directing everyone's magical energy.

Marcus stabilizes the left side of the tear.

*if training_partner = "lyra"
  Lyra handles the precise thread-weaving.

*if training_partner = "kade"
  Kade channels raw power into the repair.

*if training_partner = "selene"
  Selene tackles the complex right side independently.

*line_break

You manage the overall flow, sensing where energy is needed and redirecting it.

*page_break

It's working—

—until the tear suddenly [i]spikes[/i], doubling in size.

*line_break

Everyone's magical connections strain dangerously.

*page_break

*choice
  #Push everyone harder—we need more power NOW.
    *set trial_outcome "forced"
    *set collaboration -10

    "More power!" you shout. "Everyone, push harder!"

    *line_break

    They do.

    Marcus grits his teeth, channeling more than he should. Your partner pushes their limits.

    *page_break

    The tear starts to close—

    —but the cost is high. Everyone is dangerously overextended. Marcus collapses, magical exhaustion taking him. Your partner barely stays conscious.

    *line_break

    The tear seals.

    But you did it through force rather than finesse.

    *goto trial_resolution

  #Pull back and reassess—forcing it will hurt someone.
    *set trial_outcome "adapted"
    *set collaboration +15

    "Stop!" you call. "Everyone pull back. This approach isn't working."

    *line_break

    They hesitate, then follow your lead.

    The tear remains, but at least no one's hurt.

    *page_break

    "New plan," you say. "We're not strong enough to force this. We need to work [i]with[/i] the dimensional structure, not against it."

    *line_break

    *if class_focus = "theory"
      Your theoretical knowledge kicks in. You see the pattern—the tear wants to heal itself; you just need to support its natural restoration.

    *if class_focus = "practical"
      Your instincts guide you. You sense how the dimension [i]wants[/i] to knit back together.

    *if class_focus = "living_magic"
      You feel the World Tree's life force. It's trying to help. You just need to listen to it.

    *page_break

    "Everyone, gently. Feel the natural currents and flow with them."

    *line_break

    This time, it works beautifully.

    The tear heals smoothly, no one gets hurt, and the repair is stable.

Working as equals, you pool your knowledge.

Marcus contributes experience. Your partner contributes their unique skills. You contribute your training.

*page_break

"I see the problem," Marcus says. "The threads are tangled. We need to untangle before we can repair."

*line_break

*if training_partner = "lyra"
  Lyra nods. "I can map the tangle. Give me thirty seconds."

*if training_partner = "kade"
  Kade says, "I can hold the tear stable while we work. I'm good at sustained power output."

*if training_partner = "selene"
  Selene adds, "I can handle the complex weaving on the right side if someone stabilizes the left."

*page_break

You add your contribution:

*if class_focus = "theory"
  "I can calculate the optimal repair sequence."

*if class_focus = "practical"
  "I can sense the flow and adjust in real-time."

*if class_focus = "living_magic"
  "I can channel the World Tree's energy to support the repair."

*page_break

Together, you work.

It's not about individual brilliance—it's about perfect synchronization.

*line_break

When Marcus stumbles, your partner supports him. When your partner needs more power, you channel it. When you need information, Marcus provides it.

*page_break

The tear closes smoothly.

Not through force, but through collaboration.

*line_break

Perfect teamwork.

He coordinates well, drawing on his experience. You and your partner provide the magical power while he manages the complex weaving.

*page_break

But then Marcus hesitates.

[b]"Wait, this isn't... the pattern is different than last time. I don't..."[/b]

    *line_break

    He takes a breath.

    [b]"My instinct says... try the reverse weave pattern. It's risky, but—"[/b]

    "Then we try it. We're with you."

    *page_break

    Bolstered by your confidence, Marcus commits to his decision.

    It works.

    *line_break

    The reverse weave pattern addresses the unique structure of this tear perfectly. The repair holds strong.

    Marcus looks amazed.

    [b]"I... we did it. [b]We[/b] did it."[/b]

    "Marcus, let me," you say, stepping forward.

    *line_break

    He looks relieved but also a little hurt.

    You take over the coordination, applying what you've learned.

    *page_break

    It works, but Marcus seems diminished. You undermined his confidence when he needed support.

    The tear closes, but the team dynamic is strained.

*if trial_outcome = "collaboration"
  Your team succeeded through perfect collaboration.

  Izack appears through a portal, his face lit with genuine joy.

*if trial_outcome = "forced"
  Your team succeeded, but at a cost.

  Izack appears, his expression concerned.

  Your team succeeded, but you undermined someone's confidence.

  Aria appears, her expression neutral.

Other teams are returning too. Most succeeded. A few needed faculty intervention. Everyone looks drained but proud.

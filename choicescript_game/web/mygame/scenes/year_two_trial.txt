*comment Year Two Trial - End of Year Assessment
*comment After the major crisis, students face individual trials appropriate to their path

*comment === RECOVERY FROM CRISIS ===

The weeks following the crisis pass in a blur of reconstruction and reflection. Avalon's magnificent halls, though scarred by battle, slowly return to their former glory. You've seen students working alongside faculty to repair damaged classrooms, mend torn tapestries, and restore protective wards.

But the true healing runs deeper than stone and magic.

Today marks the final assessment of your second year—the Trial of Mastery. Unlike standard examinations, this trial is tailored specifically to your chosen path, designed to test not just what you've learned, but who you've become.

You stand in the Grand Atrium, where Headmistress Valeris addresses the assembled second-year students. Her silver hair catches the morning light streaming through the repaired stained-glass windows.

"You have all proven yourselves during the crisis," she says, her voice carrying to every corner of the vast space. "But a true mage must excel not only in moments of chaos, but in the deliberate application of their craft. Today, you will each face a trial appropriate to your specialization."

She gestures, and three doorways shimmer into existence, each marked with a different symbol.

"Research scholars, you will defend your thesis. Combat specialists, you will prove your mastery alone. Diplomats, you will broker peace where others have failed." Her gaze sweeps across the students. "These trials will determine not only your academic standing, but your readiness for the challenges of your third year."

*comment === RESEARCH PATH TRIAL ===

You step through the doorway marked with the symbol of an open book and quill. The room beyond is an intimate circular chamber, its walls lined with shelves containing ancient texts. In the center sits a curved table where five faculty members await you.

Professor Aria sits at the center, her keen eyes already assessing you. To her left is Professor Caldris, the aging master of theoretical magic. To her right, Professor Winters, who specializes in practical applications. The other two are visiting scholars from distant academies.

"Welcome, ${name}," Aria says, gesturing to the single chair facing the panel. "Please, sit."

You take your seat, acutely aware that the next hour will determine whether your research has merit—or if you've been chasing shadows.

Aria opens a leather-bound folder. "Your thesis: '${research_focus}.' An ambitious topic. Let's begin with fundamentals. Explain your central hypothesis."

        You speak with clarity and conviction, laying out your hypothesis with precision. Each word has been chosen carefully, each argument refined through countless hours of study and revision.

        Aria nods approvingly. Professor Caldris leans forward, intrigued.

        "Fascinating," Caldris murmurs. "Continue."

        Your passion for the subject shines through as you explain your work. You occasionally veer into fascinating side topics, your excitement evident in every gesture.

        Aria raises a hand gently. "Focus, please. Save the tangents for after we understand your core argument."

        You nod, redirecting your explanation.

        *goto research_questioning

    #I struggle slightly with nervousness but push through.
        *set confidence -5
        *set academic_standing_year_two "adequate"

        Your voice wavers at first, the weight of five pairs of expert eyes upon you. But you push through, remembering all the work you've invested in this research.

        Professor Winters offers an encouraging nod. "Take your time. We're here to understand your work, not to intimidate you."

        The kindness helps you find your footing.

        *goto research_questioning

*label research_questioning

The questioning begins in earnest. Professor Caldris challenges your theoretical framework. Professor Winters questions your practical applications. The visiting scholars probe for weaknesses in your methodology.

*if (intelligence >= 60)
    You field each question with growing confidence. Your research is solid, your preparation thorough. When Professor Caldris attempts to poke a hole in your theoretical model, you counter with a reference to ancient texts that supports your position.

    "Well defended," he admits grudgingly.

    *set aria_relationship +10
*else
    You do your best to answer each question, though some catch you off guard. You admit when you don't know something rather than trying to bluff, which earns you respect even when your answers aren't perfect.

    "Intellectual honesty," Aria observes. "An undervalued trait in academia."

    *set academic_reputation +5
    *set aria_relationship +5

The examination continues for what feels like hours. Your ${research_focus} research is dissected from every angle, examined for flaws, tested against alternative theories.

Finally, Aria raises her hand, silencing the other examiners.

"One final question," she says, her tone serious. "What does this research mean to you? Beyond academic achievement, why does this matter?"

*choice
    #"Because understanding this could change how we teach magic to future generations."
        *set teaching_interest +10

        *set practical_focus +10

        Professor Winters nods firmly. "Applied knowledge saves lives. Never forget that."

        *set confidence +5

The examiners huddle, conferring in low tones. Your stomach churns as you wait.

Finally, Aria stands.

    "Your thesis is approved with distinction," she announces. "Furthermore, we recommend it for publication in the Journal of Magical Theory. ${name}, you have demonstrated not only mastery of your subject, but original thinking that advances the field."

    *set confidence +8

    You accept the document, pride mixed with determination. You passed, proved yourself competent, and now you have a roadmap for improvement.

*comment === COMBAT PATH TRIAL ===

You step through the doorway marked with crossed swords. The room beyond vanishes, replaced by a swirling vortex that deposits you in a dimly lit stone corridor.

A dungeon.

The air is damp and cold, smelling of moss and ancient stone. Somewhere in the distance, you hear water dripping. Your hand instinctively goes to your weapon.

Zara's voice echoes from everywhere and nowhere. "Welcome to the Trial of Blades. This dungeon is real, drawn from the ruins beneath Avalon and repurposed for your test. The dangers are real. The magic is real. Your skill must be real."

You spot her then, standing in shadow high above you on a ledge, arms crossed.

"I'm watching," she continues, "but I will not intervene. If you're truly ready for advanced combat training, you'll reach the chamber at this dungeon's heart and claim what waits there. If you're not ready..." She shrugs. "You'll learn that too."

        *set intelligence +5
        *set tactical_thinking +15

        Before moving, you study your surroundings. The architecture, the wear patterns on the stone, the way sound carries—all of it tells a story about what dangers might lie ahead.

        *goto dungeon_navigation

*label dungeon_navigation

The corridor branches into three paths. To your left, you hear the clank of metal—animated constructs, perhaps. Straight ahead, the sound of rushing water. To your right, an eerie silence that somehow seems more threatening than the other options.

*choice
    #Take the left path—I'll smash through any constructs.
        *set chosen_dungeon_path "constructs"

The clanking grows louder as you advance. The corridor opens into a large chamber where three iron golems patrol in overlapping patterns. Their movements are precise, mechanical, deadly.

*if (combat_skill >= 60)
    You time your approach perfectly, waiting for the gap in their patrol pattern. When it comes, you strike fast—targeting joints and weak points that Zara's training has taught you to find.

    The first golem falls. The second turns, but you're already moving, using its bulk to block the third. It's a dance of violence, and you lead perfectly.

    Within minutes, all three lie in pieces.

    *set combat_skill +10

    From above, you hear Zara's approving grunt.

    *set health -15

    Pain floods your body, but you force yourself up. Zara is watching. You will not fail.

    You adapt, using the environment—a fallen pillar to trip the golem, rubble to jam its joints. It's not elegant, but it works.

    The final golem falls.

    You're battered but victorious.

    *goto dungeon_heart

*label water_path

The sound of water becomes a roar as you enter a chamber bisected by a raging underground river. The only way across is a series of crumbling platforms, some magical, some physical.

*if (magical_power >= 60)
    You analyze the magical platforms—their resonance, their stability. Some are traps, designed to collapse. But your training lets you identify the safe path.

    You cross with confidence, leaping from platform to platform. When one does start to crumble, your quick shielding spell saves you from a fall into the torrent below.

    *set magical_power +10

    From somewhere above, Zara observes your magical and physical coordination.

Then you feel it—trip wires. The corridor is laced with them, each one likely connected to something unpleasant.

*if (tactical_thinking >= 60)
    You don't just avoid the traps; you study them. Zara has taught you that understanding your enemy's tactics is as important as raw skill.

    These traps form a pattern, a psychological test as much as a physical one. You disarm several, use others against conjured shadows that lurk in alcoves, and navigate through what would have killed a less prepared student.

    *set tactical_thinking +15
    *set intelligence +10

    You avoid most of the traps, though one catches you—a blade that slices across your arm before you can fully dodge.

    *set health -10

    But you keep going, learning from each close call. By the time you reach the corridor's end, you've developed a healthy respect for the person who designed this trap sequence.

The paths converge at a massive circular chamber. In its center, on a stone pedestal bathed in ethereal light, rests a weapon—but not just any weapon.

*if (academic_standing_year_two = "excellent")
    It's magnificent: a blade forged from starlight and shadow, its edge humming with power. This is a legendary artifact, the kind that appears in stories and history books.

    Zara drops down from above, landing silently beside you.

    "That," she says, "is the Duskblade. Forged during the War of Shadows, lost for three centuries, found by Avalon's founders in these very depths. It's been waiting for a warrior worthy of its power."

You return to the Grand Atrium where other students are emerging from their own trials. Some look triumphant. Some look exhausted. All look changed.

Headmistress Valeris waits at the center, a subtle smile on her ageless face.

"Second-year students," she announces, "you have completed your trials. You have proven yourselves capable of more than mere scholarship—you have demonstrated mastery in your chosen fields."

She gestures, and magical projections appear above each student, displaying their achievements.

[i]*Caw!*[/i]

Alright, ${name}. Let me guess—you're nervous, excited, and probably wondering if that portal sickness will ever wear off.

Spoiler: it won't for another hour. You're welcome for that information.

I'm Polymnia Aetheris, but everyone calls me Polly. Yes, like the bird. No, the irony is not lost on me. I'll be your narrator, occasional advisor, and the only honest voice you'll hear today.

*line_break

Fair warning: I know how this ends. I've seen every twist, every heartbreak, every triumph. But I'll try to let you experience it fresh, even though I'm terrible at keeping secrets.

*page_break

You stand at the edge of Avalon Academy, watching the impossible Spiral Spire twist upward into clouds that shimmer with leyline energy. The World Tree's branches arc overhead, and you can [i]feel[/i] the convergence of magical currents thrumming through the air.

*line_break

This realm—Avalon itself—is alive. Not metaphorically. Izack Thorne, the greatest dimensional mage of our age, literally [i]created[/i] a sentient pocket dimension that grows like a living thing.

And you're about to become part of it.

*page_break

Through the crystalline gates ahead, you can see the courtyard. Izack himself is waiting to meet the new arrivals.

[i]Fair warning: he's brilliant, kind, and will absolutely try to convince you that listening to magical currents is more important than controlling them. He's not wrong, but don't tell him I said that.[/i]

*line_break

So, ${name}. How do you want to make your entrance?

    Smart. Politeness costs nothing and earns everything. Well, sometimes.

    [i]Smart. Ask the raven who's been here since the beginning. I like you already.[/i]

  #Walk past confidently—you've read about Avalon and know what you're doing.
    *set intro_choice "confident"

    [i]*Caw!* Oh, we have a confident one. This should be entertaining.[/i]

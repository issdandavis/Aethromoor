# Repository Organization Complete ✅

## Latest Organization Update (Nov 2025):

### **1. Cleaned Up the Structure**
Moved all files into organized folders:
- **lore/** - All worldbuilding documents (chronicles, appendices, PDFs)
- **writing_drafts/** - Novel manuscripts and story content (20+ files)
- **archive/** - Old chat logs, conversation exports, and bundles
- **music/** - FL Studio audio project files
- **game/** - HTML game (unchanged, still works!)
- **choicescript_game/** - Professional version
- **docs/** - Project documentation
- **Added .gitignore** - Excludes system files, temp files, and personal notes

### **2. Created Navigation Guides**
Made it super easy to find things:
- **START_HERE.md** - Simplest possible instructions
- **README.md** - Complete project overview with folder structure
- **FILE_LOCATIONS.txt** - Quick reference for where everything is
- **QUICK_START.md** - Detailed playing instructions (already existed)

### **3. What's Where Now**

# Repository Organization - Consolidated & Unified ✅

## Consolidation Complete (November 2025)

### **What Was Done:**

The repository has been fully consolidated into a unified system with no duplicate files across branches/directories.

### **1. Eliminated Duplicate Directories**
- **Removed:** `AvalonBook STUFF/` (77 files) - was duplicate of `docs/avalon_materials/`
- **Result:** Single source of truth for all reference materials

### **2. Consolidated Root Directory**
Moved scattered files to organized locations:
- **Lore files** → `lore/`
- **Writing drafts** → `writing_drafts/`
- **Project docs** → `docs/`
- **Archives** → `archive/`
- **Personal files** → Added to `.gitignore`

### **3. Removed Personal/Temporary Files**
Added to `.gitignore` and removed from tracking:
- Music production files (*.flp)
- Game configuration files (*.log, *.xml)
- Shortcuts and personal notes
- Temporary files

### **4. What's Where Now**

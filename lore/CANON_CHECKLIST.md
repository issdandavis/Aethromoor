## 📝 LORE ADDITION CHECKLIST

**Before adding new lore, ask:**

- [ ] Does this contradict established canon?
- [ ] Does this align with collaborative magic philosophy?
- [ ] Does this fit the "dark setting, happy ending" tone?
- [ ] Have I checked existing lore files for related info?
- [ ] Does this enhance the story without breaking existing content?
- [ ] Is this necessary or just "cool but random"?
- [ ] Can this be approved by @issdandavis?

**If unsure, mark as [DRAFT] and @ @issdandavis for clarification.**

These areas have basic framework but welcome expansion:

✅ **Artifact lore** - Magical items and their histories  
✅ **Cultural elements** - Holidays, traditions, customs  
✅ **Minor characters** - Supporting cast for scenes

## 📚 PRIMARY CANON SOURCES

**@ @issdandavis - THESE ARE THE AUTHORITATIVE SOURCES:**

1. `/lore/` directory - All files here are canonical

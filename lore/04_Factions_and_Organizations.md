# Factions and Organizations of the Spiral of Pollyoneth

*Compiled from Issues #3, #4, and #5 - Political Entities, Guilds, and Magical Orders*

## THE THREE GREAT POWERS

The magical realms are dominated by three major faction groupings, each representing a fundamental approach to magic and power. Think of them as the great civilizations of this magical universe, each with their own philosophy, structure, and military doctrine.

*"The fascinating aspect of these factions isn't their differences—it's their potential for convergence. Every conflict is just a conversation we haven't figured out how to have yet. Some of us are just more stubborn about learning that lesson."*

**—Polly, on faction politics**

*"Power structures exist to serve people, not the other way around. Any faction that forgets that is already on the path to irrelevance, whether they know it or not."*

**—Izack Thorne, Year 50 address to Realm Council**

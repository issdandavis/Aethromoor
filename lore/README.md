## IMPORTANT NOTE: Clay/Clayborn Distinction

**CLAY** (Original):
- Created on beach from sand and water
- **Izack's FIRST magical act post-amnesia**
- Simple Unseen Servant, constant early companion

**CLAYBORN** (Later):
- Created by Grey (Golem Commander)
- Advanced living golem with music-sensitive consciousness
- Different entity from Clay

**This correction is reflected throughout all documentation.**

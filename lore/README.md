> — Izack Thorne

### Collaborative Power
> "Alone, we are single notes—beautiful, perhaps, but incomplete. Together, we become symphony, each voice essential to the whole."  
> — Guild Charters, Year 5

### Redemption and Growth
> "I thought my title made me special. Turns out, everyone's special. My title just gives me responsibility to help others shine."  
> — Prince Rupert (reformed)

### Cosmic Humor
> "Magic is just the universe's way of having a sense of humor. The trick is learning to laugh along."  
> — Polly

## 🪶 A Note from the Archivist

*Dear Reader,*

*Welcome to five centuries of accumulated wisdom, occasional chaos, and surprisingly good jokes for a cosmic entity. I've been chronicling this story since Izack first started arguing with rocks (yes, that actually happened), and I can confirm that what you're about to read is, improbably, all true.*

*Well, mostly true. I may have embellished some parts for dramatic effect. And I definitely made myself sound more patient than I actually was during certain incidents. But the important bits—the magic, the love, the laughter, the profound realization that connection is the only truth—those are real.*

*Read in whatever order calls to you. The Spiral doesn't believe in linear progression anyway.*

*May your questions lead to better questions, and may you never have to argue with sedimentary deposits to learn basic magical courtesy.*

*—Polly*

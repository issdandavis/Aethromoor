- **Boundaries as Membranes**: Magical barriers are negotiable interfaces
- **Connection over Power**: Relationships and understanding trump raw force
- **Innovation through Understanding**: True breakthroughs come from listening to magic itself

## Complete Timeline

### THE BEACH AWAKENING - Day One
**The Beginning of Everything**

Izack wakes on a mysterious beach with fragmented memories and disrupted dimensional storage magic. This is where his journey truly begins.

**Key Moments:**
1. **Wakes with amnesia** - partial memories, disoriented
2. **Creates Clay (First Unseen Servant)** - fashioned from sand and water on the beach
   - *This is Izack's first conscious magical act in his new state*
   - Clay becomes his constant companion and helper
   - Demonstrates his instinctive dimensional magic even in disrupted state
3. **Explores shipwreck** - finds tantalizing clues but incomplete understanding
4. **Discovers dimensional storage disrupted** - can only access fragments
5. **Begins inland journey** - following mysterious footprints

**Significance:** The creation of Clay marks Izack's first step toward understanding magic as connection rather than command. This simple construct would later evolve into the foundation for all living magical constructs in Avalon.

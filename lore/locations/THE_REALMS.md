**Nature:** Logic-entangled pain, infernal hierarchy, recursive existence

---

### Fundamental Nature

#### Logic-Entangled Pain
The realm operates on principles alien to mortal understanding:
- **Pain as Structure**: Suffering is foundational reality
- **Logic Binding**: Contradictions create physical form
- **Recursive Existence**: Actions loop back on themselves

---

### Governance & Society

#### Recursive Contracts
**Foundation of Demon Society**

**How It Works:**
- Every action creates obligation
- Debts can be traded, sold, inherited
- Breaking contract = fundamental reality violation

- Debt payment creates new debt
- Escape attempts deepen entanglement
- Freedom requires perfect contract fulfillment

#### Soul-Debts
**Currency and Consequence**

**Nature:**
- Pieces of consciousness as tradeable commodity

- Complete debt = total annihilation

- Social control

## TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### Common Questions During Development

**Q: How much agency does the player have vs. fixed story?**
**A:** Player chooses: Guild, romance partner, collaborative vs. solo approach, consciousness evolution decision, crisis solutions. Fixed: Izack/Aria as founders, Alexander's existence, Third Awakening event.

**Q: Can player reject collaborative magic entirely?**
**A:** Mechanically possible but narratively discouraged. Lower power ceiling, different ending type ("Individual Excellence"), missed romance content.

**Q: How do I balance multiple romance options with Izack/Aria canon?**
**A:** Player is NOT Izack. Player is student at Izack's academy. Izack/Aria are established couple, NPCs. Player chooses own romance from fellow students.

**Q: What if player choices conflict with lore?**
**A:** Core lore (Academy exists, Izack founded it, Third Awakening approaching) is fixed. Player affects: personal relationships, magical approach, role in crisis, ending type.

**Q: How detailed should magic mechanics be?**
**A:** Detailed enough for player understanding (Sanderson's First Law), but leave room for mystery (Third Thread). Show costs clearly (aging, exhaustion). Make choices meaningful.

**Q: Can characters die?**
**A:** In bad endings or very poor choices, yes. Main characters (Izack, Aria, Alexander) should survive for lore consistency. Companions and RO could be at risk in crisis scenes for stakes.

## FINAL NOTES FOR GAME DEVELOPERS

### Core Principles

1. **Emotion Drives Magic** - Every magical success must connect to emotional honesty
2. **Relationships = Power** - Collaborative magic is mechanically strongest
3. **Choices Matter** - Track variables, show consequences
4. **Characters First** - World serves character development, not vice versa
5. **Mystery Gradual** - Third Thread, Polly's nature, etc. revealed over time
6. **Cost Everything** - Time ages you, dimensional magic thins reality, evolution risks identity
7. **Found Family** - Central theme in all paths
8. **Hope Endures** - Even tragic endings have hope for future

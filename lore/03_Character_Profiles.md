**Sample Wingscroll Entries:**

*Day 23:*
> "Observed a fascinating phenomenon today: when humans work together on magic, they become more than the sum of their parts. When they work against each other, they become less than their individual potential. Either cooperation is magical in itself, or humans are naturally collaborative creatures who suffer when forced into competition. Neither can the humans themselves figure this out, most of the time. —P"

*Day 347:*
> "Day 347 of watching humans discover that magic works better when you're nice to it. You'd think this would be obvious, but apparently it takes a talking raven to explain basic courtesy to people who can bend reality with their thoughts. The irony is not lost on me. —P"

*Year 50 Reflection:*
> "Fifty years. In the grand scheme of things, it's barely a moment. But from my perch in this tower, watching the Academy bustle with life below, it feels like watching the universe learn to dance. I can't wait to see what the next fifty bring. —P"

**Signature Quotes:**
- *"Where boundaries blur, something always listens."*
- *"Magic is just the universe's way of having a sense of humor. The trick is learning to laugh along."*
- *"The problem is that you're trying to command instead of collaborate. Rocks respond much better to suggestions than demands."*
- *"Did you really think someone else was keeping track of all this beautiful chaos?"*

**Mysteries About Polly:**

❌ INCORRECT:
"You should do the collaborative option." (too direct, not playful)

```

## 🌀 Magic System Canon

### The Spiral of Pollyoneth - Core Concepts

**Dimensional Theory:**
- Magic draws from parallel dimensions
- Collaboration creates stronger connections
- Domination creates unstable, temporary power
- Each dimension has unique properties

**Collaborative vs. Hierarchical Magic:**
```
COLLABORATIVE:
- Partnership with dimensional entities
- Sustainable, stable magic
- Respects autonomy of all parties
- Izack's revolutionary approach

HIERARCHICAL:
- Forcing/commanding magical forces
- Temporary, draining magic
- Traditional but limited approach
- What Izack moved away from
```

**Realm-Specific Magic:**

**Singing Dunes (Desert):**
- Truth-binding magic (oath-sworn power)
- Sand remembers words spoken
- Kael: Desert guide, truth-keeper
- Magic responds to honesty, punishes deception

**Verdant Tithe (Forest):**
- Sentient plant consciousness
- Thoughtvine: Intellectual connection
- Dreamwillow: Emotional/subconscious connection
- Heartwood: Heart/core truth connection
- Forest reads intentions, not just actions

**Rune Glacier (Ice Realm):**
- Living ice, crystallized memories
- Frozen spell library (ancient knowledge)
- Ice responds to respect and precision
- Can partner with glacier consciousness

## 🌍 Geography & Realms

**The Spiral Structure:**
- Multiple dimensions arranged in spiral pattern
- Each "ring" of spiral = different dimensional layer
- Travel between rings possible with proper magic
- Some realms more accessible than others

**Key Locations:**
- **Avalon Academy**: Founded by Izack, dimensional crossroads
- **Mortal Realm**: Where Izack eventually rules as king
- **Singing Dunes**: Desert dimension, truth magic domain
- **Verdant Tithe**: Forest dimension, sentient plant realm
- **Rune Glacier**: Ice dimension, memory and knowledge realm
- **Demon Realms**: Antagonistic dimensions (future threat)

## ✏️ Editing Lore Files

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Lore Changes Require Extreme Care

**Before editing ANY lore file:**
1. ✅ Verify change doesn't contradict existing canon
2. ✅ Cross-reference character timelines for consistency
3. ✅ Check impact on all generations (150+ year timeline)
4. ✅ Verify magic system logic remains coherent
5. ✅ Update ALL affected documents (no orphan changes)
6. ✅ Document change rationale in commit message

### When Lore Changes ARE Appropriate:
- Expanding on briefly mentioned details (adding depth, not contradiction)
- Clarifying ambiguous canon (resolving conflicts)
- Adding new minor characters (that don't affect main timeline)
- Developing secondary realms (not featured in current game)
- Adding cultural details (language, customs, etc.)

### When Lore Changes ARE NOT Appropriate:
- ❌ Changing established character personalities
- ❌ Altering main character relationships
- ❌ Modifying core magic system principles
- ❌ Changing timeline events
- ❌ Contradicting published/public content
- ❌ Removing established canon without replacement

## 🔍 Lore Validation Workflow

**When writing new game content, validate against lore:**

1. **Character Check**:
   - Does dialogue match character's established voice?
   - Are personality traits consistent?
   - Is timeline/age appropriate for this moment?

2. **Magic System Check**:
   - Does magic follow dimensional theory?
   - Is collaborative approach emphasized?
   - Are realm-specific properties respected?

3. **Relationship Check**:
   - Are character dynamics consistent?
   - Do NPCs interact as established?
   - Is history between characters acknowledged?

4. **Timeline Check**:
   - What generation is this?
   - Who is alive/dead at this point?
   - Are references to past events accurate?

# 🎉 What's New - Repository Organization Complete!

**Date:** November 2024

## Major Update: All Files Renamed for Easy Access

We've completely reorganized and renamed **100+ files** across the entire repository to make everything easier to find and use, especially for non-technical collaborators!

## 🌟 What Changed?

### **Every file now has a clear, consistent name:**
- ✅ No more spaces in filenames

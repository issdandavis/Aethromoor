- **Collaborative vs. Hierarchical Magic** - Can power be shared, or must it be controlled?
- **Dimensional Theory** - Multiple realms connected by magical resonance

- **Aria Ravencrest** - Master of boundary magic and political intrigue

**Generation 2-4**
- **Alexander Thorne** - Izack's son, struggling with legacy
- **Zara Moonwhisper** - Living magic specialist
- And many more across 150+ years of history...

### Magic Systems

- **Collaborative Casting** - Shared dimensional magic requiring trust and partnership
- **Dimensional Resonance** - Realms connected through harmonic frequencies
- **Living Magic** - Sentient natural forces (Thoughtvine, Dreamwillow, Heartwood)

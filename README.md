# Avalon Repository Overview

This repository contains narrative source material and chat logs related to the Avalon/Spiral of Eternity world, plus a small ChoiceScript scaffold to help you spin up a runnable prototype locally.

## Project layout
- `docs/avalon_materials/` — all reference documents, drafts, and PDFs that were previously in `AvalonBook STUFF`.
- `docs/reference/` — miscellaneous reference files that were loose in the repo (chat logs, PDFs, and links).
- `config/.env.example` — template for API keys and other sensitive values. Copy to `.env` and fill in your own credentials.
- `game/` — ChoiceScript helper scripts, sample scenes, and README for running the demo (with stats screen and branching scenes).

## Getting ready to add game files
1. Install Node.js (LTS) and Git.
2. From the repo root, run `./game/bootstrap_choicescript.sh` to clone the official ChoiceScript engine locally under `game/choicescript/`.
3. Run `./game/sync_scenes.sh` to copy the demo scenes into `game/choicescript/web/mygame/`.
4. Start the ChoiceScript server from inside `game/choicescript/` (`run-server.bat` on Windows, `serve.command` on macOS, `bash serve.sh` on Linux/WSL), then open the browser at `http://localhost:4200/` if it does not open automatically.
5. Edit scenes in `game/scenes/` and re-run `./game/sync_scenes.sh` to refresh the playable build.

## 🤖 Automation & Connected Accounts
This repository features AI-powered automation for inter-account communications and progress tracking. All automation runs in **silent mode** by default (no user notifications for routine updates).

**Key Features:**
- Automated progress tracking and metrics
- Silent content synchronization
- Quality checks and validation
- Daily maintenance tasks

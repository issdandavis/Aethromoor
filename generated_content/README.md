# Generated Content Directory

This directory contains content automatically generated by the AI Agent system.

## Structure

Each generation run creates a timestamped subdirectory:

```
generated_content/
├── 2024-01-15_02-00/
│   ├── GENERATION_LOG.md
│   ├── scene_singing_dunes_expansion.txt
│   └── lore_midnight_council.md
├── 2024-01-16_02-00/
│   ├── GENERATION_LOG.md
│   └── ...
└── README.md (this file)
```

## What's Inside

### GENERATION_LOG.md
Each run includes a log file with:
- Tasks completed
- Quality metrics
- Validation results
- Integration status

### Generated Files
Actual content files created by the Content Generator Agent:
- Game scenes (`.txt` ChoiceScript files)
- Lore entries (`.md` Markdown files)
- Dialogue variations
- Documentation

## Review Process

1. **Agent generates content** - Creates files in timestamped directory
2. **Validation runs** - Lore Curator checks consistency
3. **Organization** - Content Organizer categorizes and tags
4. **PR created** - Changes submitted for human review
5. **Human approval** - You review and merge if approved
6. **Integration** - Merged content moves to appropriate directories

## Quality Assurance

All generated content goes through:
- ✅ Syntax validation
- ✅ Canon compliance check
- ✅ Voice consistency verification
- ✅ Integration assessment
- ✅ Quality scoring

Only content meeting minimum thresholds is submitted for review.

## Reviewing Generated Content

When reviewing:

### Check Character Voices
- Does Polly sound sarcastic but caring?
- Is Izack humble and wise?
- Are personalities consistent?

### Verify Canon Compliance
- No contradictions with established lore?
- Timeline makes sense?
- Magic system rules followed?

### Assess Quality
- Writing is engaging?
- Choices are meaningful?
- Proper formatting?

### Test Integration
- Fits with existing content?
- Cross-references make sense?
- File organization correct?

## Approval Guidelines

✅ **Approve if:**
- Quality meets standards
- No canon violations
- Character voices match
- Integrates smoothly

🔄 **Request changes if:**
- Minor quality issues
- Small voice adjustments needed
- Integration tweaks required

❌ **Reject if:**
- Major canon contradictions
- Quality far below standards
- Character voices completely off

## After Approval

Once you approve and merge a PR:
1. Content moves to permanent locations
2. Indexes are updated
3. Generated directory can be cleaned up
4. Agents learn from the acceptance

## Cleanup

Old generated content directories can be deleted once merged:

```bash
# Keep last 7 days, delete older
find generated_content -type d -mtime +7 -exec rm -rf {} \;
```

Or manually review and delete merged content.

## Configuration

Generation behavior is controlled by:
- `.github/agents/config/content_generator_config.yml`
- `.github/workflows/daily-content-generation.yml`

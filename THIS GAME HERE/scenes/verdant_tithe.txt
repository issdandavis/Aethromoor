The portal opens onto an ocean of green.

Trees larger than Avalon's towers rise into mist, their canopy creating a twilight world below. The air itself feels [i]alive[/i]—thick with the scent of growing things and something else...

Awareness.

*page_break

Izack leads this expedition personally. "Welcome to the Verdant Tithe, one of Avalon's transplanted biomes drawn from the ancient forests of Nirestal. Here, every thought has weight."

*line_break

As if to demonstrate, a vine near you shifts, reaching toward a student who's thinking intensely about their family. The plant seems to [i]sense[/i] the emotion.

*line_break

[i]*Perched on Izack's shoulder* "The Thoughtvines are just the beginning. In the deep forest, the trees themselves remember every person who's passed through. Try to keep your mind calm—anxious thoughts attract attention you don't want."[/i]

*page_break

Izack nods. "The Tithe takes a piece of your consciousness as payment for passage—usually just surface thoughts or recent memories. In return, it offers guidance and protection. But you must learn to quiet your mind."

*line_break

Your group begins walking the forest path. Around you, luminescent fungi bloom in response to your footsteps, and you swear you can hear whispers in the rustling leaves.

*line_break

The forest is [i]thinking[/i].

*page_break

Suddenly, the path ahead splits into three directions. Each trail seems to call to different aspects of your mind—pulling at your curiosity, your memories, your deepest self.

*line_break

Izack smiles knowingly. "The forest is testing you. Choose the path that resonates, but understand—each leads to a different lesson."

The Dreamwillow grove is breathtaking. Silver leaves shimmer overhead, and the air is heavy with possibility—as if reality itself is thinner here, more malleable.

*line_break

Izack gestures for the group to sit beneath the largest tree, its trunk wider than three men standing side by side.

"Dreamwillows show visions of possible futures," he explains softly. "But be warned—they show [i]all[/i] possibilities, not just pleasant ones. The forest wants you to understand that every choice branches reality."

*page_break

As you lean against the silvery bark, drowsiness overtakes you. Your vision blurs, and suddenly you're seeing...

*line_break

[i]...yourself, years older, standing at the heart of Avalon's Spiral Spire, guiding dozens of students through a complex collaborative spell. The vision feels warm, right, [b]possible[/b].[/i]

*page_break

[i]...yourself, alone in a tower, surrounded by books and power, having mastered magic but lost all your connections. Cold. Empty. A warning.[/i]

*page_break

[i]...yourself, standing at a threshold between Avalon and the demon realm Varn'ka'zul, making a choice that will determine the fate of both worlds. The weight of it crushes you.[/i]

*page_break

The visions fade. You gasp, returning to the present with a racing heart.

*line_break

[i]"The Dreamwillows don't tell you which future is 'right.' They just show you that your choices matter. What you do now echoes forward into all possible tomorrows."[/i]

*line_break

Izack places a hand on your shoulder, his touch grounding. "The forest has shown you its deepest lesson: magic is choice, and every choice shapes not just you, but the world around you."

The Thoughtvines grow so thick here that they form living walls, pulsing gently with bioluminescent light that breathes in time with your heartbeat.

*line_break

As you walk among them, you feel your thoughts becoming... [i]shared[/i].

*line_break

It's not invasive—more like your consciousness is expanding to include the forest itself. You can sense the other students' wonder, Izack's pride, Polly's amused observation.

And beneath it all, the forest's vast, ancient mind.

*page_break

[i]"This is what the Third Thread feels like—consciousness braiding together. Not domination, not submission, just... connection. Multiple minds becoming something greater."[/i]

*line_break

A memory that isn't yours surfaces: you see this forest centuries ago, feel the Dryads singing it into awareness, experience the moment it first began to [i]think[/i].

*line_break

The forest is sharing itself with you.

*page_break

Izack's voice cuts through gently. "You're experiencing the forest's living memory. It's offering you a gift—understanding of how collaboration at the deepest level feels."

*line_break

The vines pulse brighter, and you feel a question form in your mind—not in words, but in pure meaning:

*line_break

[i]Will you remember me? Will you carry this connection forward?[/i]

*line_break

The forest wants to know if you'll honor what you've learned here.

    "I will," you speak aloud and in thought simultaneously. "I'll remember. I'll carry you with me."

    *goto forest_bond_accepted

  #Accept the gift gratefully but make no binding promises.
    *set forest_blessing false

    You bow respectfully to the forest's presence, grateful but cautious about promises you're unsure you can keep.

    The vines dim slightly—not rejection, but understanding.

The Thoughtvines surge with light, wrapping gently around your arms, your shoulders, leaving patterns of silver-green that fade into your skin like tattoos made of living chlorophyll.

*line_break

[i]"Oh. Oh wow. The forest just [b]bonded[/b] with you. That's... that's never happened to a student before. Even Izack doesn't have that."[/i]

*page_break

Izack stares, wonder and something like envy crossing his face. "You've achieved true symbiosis. A piece of the Verdant Tithe lives within you now. You'll carry its awareness, its memory, its life force."

*line_break

You can feel it—the whisper of leaves in your mind, the slow growth of roots beneath your feet even when you stand on stone, the patient wisdom of trees that have lived a thousand years.

*line_break

You are no longer entirely human. You are [i]more[/i].

The path leads deep into the forest's heart, where even Izack walks with reverence.

*line_break

The trees here are impossibly ancient, their bark inscribed with natural runes that glow faintly with their own inner light. The air thrums with old magic.

*line_break

At the center stands a tree unlike any other.

*page_break

[b]The Heartwood Tree.[/b]

*line_break

It's massive beyond belief, with bark that seems to pulse like a heartbeat and roots that disappear into glowing earth. You can feel its awareness—vast, patient, kind but utterly inhuman.

*line_break

[i]*Unusually quiet* "This is one of the oldest living things in any realm. It was here before Avalon, before Izack, before most of what we call civilization. It's the forest's heart and mind made manifest."[/i]

*page_break

Izack bows respectfully to the tree. "The Heartwood only reveals itself to those it wishes to teach. You've been [i]called[/i] here."

*line_break

As you approach, the tree's roots shift, creating a natural seat at its base. The invitation is clear.

*line_break

You sit.

*page_break

Understanding floods through you like sunlight through leaves:

*line_break

You feel the interconnection of all living things—how every breath you take feeds the plants, how every plant's gift feeds you. You understand that magic isn't something you [i]do[/i], it's something you [i]participate in[/i].

*line_break

Life is not separate. Life is [b]one[/b].

*page_break

The Heartwood offers you a single fruit—golden, glowing with concentrated life essence, pulsing with a heartbeat that matches your own.

*line_break

Izack's eyes widen. "I've visited this tree a hundred times. It's never offered its fruit before."

*line_break

[i]"If you eat that, you'll be bonded to the forest forever. You'll carry a piece of the Verdant Tithe in your soul. That's not a small thing, ${name}. That's... that's becoming something entirely new."[/i]

The world explodes into connection.

Every living thing in Avalon suddenly feels [i]close[/i]—you sense the golem Clayborn's growing consciousness, the fish in Avalon's Time Ocean swimming through memory, the students' hopes and fears pulsing like heartbeats.

*line_break

You've become part of life's great web.

*line_break

[i]*Tears streaming* "Do you know what you just did? The Heartwood hasn't chosen a guardian in three thousand years. You're bonded to one of the oldest, wisest living things in existence. I'm actually crying. Caw."[/i]

*page_break

Izack kneels before you in respect. "You carry the forest's heart now. When you speak, ancient wisdom speaks through you. When you act, the pattern of life itself guides you."

*line_break

Aria appears—you sense her before you see her, her life force bright and structured like a boundary made flesh.

"I've spent my life studying boundaries," she says, wonder in her voice. "You just erased them. You exist in perfect balance between human and forest, individual and collective, mortal and eternal."

The Heartwood's awareness shifts—and you sense... approval?

The tree's roots form a different pattern, and a single leaf falls into your hand—silver-edged, glowing faintly with preserved life force.

*line_break

[i]"The tree respects your honesty. By admitting you're not ready, you proved the wisdom it was looking for. That leaf is a promise—when you ARE ready, the Heartwood will remember you."[/i]

  You are forever changed. Thoughtvines grow where you walk, plants bloom in your presence, and the whisper of leaves follows you even in stone corridors. You are the forest's ambassador to the world of mages.

*if forest_blessing
  The forest blessed you. You carry its wisdom forward.

*line_break

Izack addresses the group one final time. "You've learned that consciousness itself can be shared, that boundaries between self and other are negotiable, that life speaks in languages older than words."

*line_break

[i]"Translation: you learned that magic isn't something you own—it's something you're part of. The forest taught you. Now go be part of something bigger."[/i]

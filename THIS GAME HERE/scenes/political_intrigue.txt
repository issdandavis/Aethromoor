[b]== POLITICAL INTRIGUE ==[/b]

*line_break

Three months into Year Three, academy politics erupt into something impossible to ignore.

*page_break

It starts with a simple announcement at morning assembly.

*line_break

Aria stands before the gathered students, her expression more severe than usual.

[b]"The Student Council will hold elections this month. Third-year students are eligible to run for leadership positions. The council advises administration on policy, mediates student concerns, and represents Avalon's interests to external organizations."[/b]

*page_break

*if polly_is_familiar = true
  [i]"Translation: student politics. All the drama of real politics but with the added complication that everyone involved can literally reshape reality with magic."[/i]

  *line_break

  "Is it always this... tense?"

  *line_break

  [i]"Oh, you have no idea. Last year's election involved three reality fractures, two duels, and one candidate who accidentally turned himself into a sentient debate trophy. Politics plus magic equals entertainment."[/i]

"Are you really running? Because... I hope you win. Cassian scares me. Lyra makes me feel stupid. Devon's nice but I don't think he'd actually change anything."

      Your truth magic helps. Students can [i]feel[/i] your sincerity when you speak. It's impossible to fake the resonance of genuine commitment.

    It's exhausting. Every conversation requires nuance, careful thought, acknowledgment that you don't have all the answers.

    Some students appreciate it. Others find it frustrating—they want simple solutions, not complex realities.

    *page_break

    You craft targeted messages for each group, emphasizing how your leadership would address their specific needs.

    *line_break

    It works. Your poll numbers rise.

    *line_break

    But you start to notice contradictions in your own promises. You've told combat students you'll prioritize training resources while telling research students you'll expand laboratory funding. Both require the same limited budget.

    Student politics, campaign promises, the constant scrutiny—it's not why you came to Avalon. You came to learn magic, not navigate political maneuvering.

    You formally withdraw your nomination.

    The election continues without you. Devon Brightwater eventually wins—a safe, uncontroversial choice.

    You spend two hours in the most rigorous mock debate of your life. Aria attacks every weakness in your arguments, forces you to defend positions from multiple angles, makes you articulate principles you didn't realize you held.

*label debate

The Hall of Threads is packed.

*line_break

Every student. All faculty. Even some visitors from other realms who heard about Avalon's "experimental democratic governance model."

*page_break

The four candidates sit on stage. You can feel hundreds of eyes assessing you.

*line_break

*if spell_truth_sense = true
  Your truth sense is overwhelming in this environment. Dozens of people with hidden agendas, private fears, secret hopes. The emotional currents are dizzying.

  *line_break

  You force yourself to focus.

*page_break

Aria moderates. She wastes no time on pleasantries.

[b]"First question: Avalon Academy faces limited resources. How do you prioritize funding between combat training, research facilities, and diplomatic programs?"[/b]

*page_break

*if campaign_strategy = "honest"
  You answer honestly: "That's a false choice. All three are essential to Avalon's mission. The real question is how we increase total resources through better inter-realm partnerships, alumni contributions, and efficient resource sharing."

  *line_break

  *if knowledge >= 60
    You provide specific examples—dimensional efficiency improvements that could reduce operational costs, collaborative research programs that could attract external funding.

    *set political_allies +2

  *line_break

  Some faculty members nod approvingly. Aria's expression remains neutral, but you think you see a flicker of respect.

*if campaign_strategy = "strategic"
  You've prepared for this. You pivot to discuss "strategic investment priorities that maximize outcomes across all programs."

  *line_break

  It sounds good. It's deliberately vague enough that everyone can project their preferred priorities onto it.

  *line_break

  *if spell_truth_sense = true
    But your truth sense screams at you. The answer is technically accurate but emotionally dishonest. You're avoiding the hard question instead of answering it.

    *set honesty_vs_deception -5
    *set stress +10

  *line_break

  Still, it plays well politically. No one can attack you for an answer that doesn't actually commit to anything.

  *set political_allies +1

*if campaign_strategy = "idealistic"
  You answer from principles: "Avalon was founded on collaborative magic. Combat, research, and diplomacy aren't competing priorities—they're complementary approaches. We need to break down the artificial barriers between paths and create integrated programs."

  *line_break

  It's a bold answer. It challenges the current structure.

  *line_break

  Cassian immediately attacks: "So your solution to limited resources is to just... wish them away with collaboration magic? That's not a budget plan. That's fantasy."

  *set political_enemies +1

*page_break

The debate continues for two hours.

*line_break

Questions range from practical (student safety protocols) to philosophical (Avalon's relationship with non-magical realms) to deeply personal (how your background shapes your leadership approach).

*page_break

*if empathy >= 70
  Your empathy serves you well. You can sense what questioners really care about beneath their surface concerns. You address underlying fears and hopes, not just stated questions.

  *set political_allies +2

*if power >= 70
  At one point, Cassian tries to intimidate you with a subtle display of combat magic—letting power crackle around his hands while you speak.

  *line_break

  You match it effortlessly, your own magic manifesting as calm, controlled brilliance.

  *line_break

  The message is clear: you're not afraid of him.

  *set political_allies +1
  *set political_enemies +1

The final question comes from a first-year student, voice shaking with nervousness:

*line_break

"Why do you want to lead?"

*page_break

*if campaign_strategy = "honest"
  You pause, considering the question seriously.

  "I'm not sure I do want to lead. Leadership sounds exhausting. But I care about Avalon—what it stands for, what it could become. And I think I have ideas that could help. That's enough reason to try."

  *line_break

  The hall is silent.

  *line_break

  Then slow, building applause. It's not universal—some students clearly wanted a more inspiring answer—but it's genuine.

*if campaign_strategy = "strategic"
  You deliver the answer you've prepared: inspirational language about service, opportunity, responsibility. It's a good answer. Professional. Polished.

  *line_break

  Also completely calculated.

  *line_break

  The applause is polite but measured. No one doubts your competence. Some wonder about your authenticity.

*if campaign_strategy = "idealistic"
  You speak from the heart.

  "Because I believe in what Izack Thorne created here. A place where magic is collaborative, where dimensional boundaries are conversations not barriers, where we learn to work [i]with[/i] reality instead of dominating it. That vision is worth fighting for."

  *line_break

  Half the hall erupts in applause. The other half looks skeptical.

  *line_break

  You've inspired your supporters and confirmed your opponents' view that you're naive.

*page_break

And quietly, a third group emerges—the [b]Radicals[/b].

They want to overthrow the current system entirely. Replace faculty governance with full student democracy. Reject all external partnerships. Make Avalon completely autonomous.

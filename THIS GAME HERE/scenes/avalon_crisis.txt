[b]== THE AVALON CRISIS ==[/b]

*line_break

It begins with a scream.

*page_break

Not a human scream—a dimensional scream. The fabric of Avalon itself crying out in pain.

*line_break

Alarms blare. Students rush from buildings. Faculty members race toward the Spiral Spire, where reality is tearing apart.

*page_break

[i]"This is it. The crisis I've been warning you about. Something is trying to destroy Avalon."[/i]

*line_break

Through the tears in reality, you see them: entities from beyond the dimensional boundaries. Hostile forces that view Avalon as an abomination—a realm that shouldn't exist.

*page_break

Izack, Aria, and Zara stand at the forefront, casting defensive magic.

But even they're struggling.

*line_break

[b]"Students!"[/b] Izack calls out. [b]"We need everyone! This is bigger than anything we've faced!"[/b]

You raise your voice above the chaos:

[b]"Everyone! Link your magic with mine! We stand together!"[/b]

*page_break

And they do.

*line_break

Student and faculty alike, you form a massive collaborative network. Hundreds of mages, one unified intention.

*page_break

The hostile entities strike—

—and shatter against your perfect unity.

*line_break

Avalon doesn't just survive. It grows stronger.

You step forward, using truth magic to communicate.

*line_break

[b]"Why are you attacking? What do you want?"[/b]

*page_break

The entities respond—

*line_break

They believe Avalon is destabilizing dimensional reality. They're trying to protect their own realms.

*page_break

You explain Izack's safeguards. You offer to prove Avalon is stable.

*line_break

*if truth_magic >= 60
  Using truth magic, you show them the truth. They see Avalon's stability.

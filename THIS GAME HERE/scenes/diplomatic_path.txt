The morning sun filters through stained glass windows as you make your way to the Diplomatic Wing—a section of Avalon you'd barely noticed before choosing this specialization. The architecture here is different, more open, with soaring archways that seem to shimmer with dimensional energy.

Izack waits for you at the entrance, his silver eyes gleaming with quiet satisfaction. "Welcome to your true education," he says. "Everything you've learned so far has been preparation. Now, we begin the real work."

He gestures, and the air ripples. Through the shimmer, you glimpse other places—crystalline cities, floating gardens, realms of perpetual twilight. "These are our neighbors," Izack explains. "Hundreds of dimensions, each with their own magical traditions, their own cultures, their own... conflicts."

*set dimensional_magic %+10

"War between dimensions is catastrophic," he continues, his voice taking on a grave tone. "I've seen entire realities torn apart by misunderstanding and pride. That's why I created Avalon—not just as a school, but as neutral ground. A place where different worlds can meet, learn, communicate."

He turns to you, and there's an intensity in his gaze you've rarely seen. "You have a gift for understanding people, for building bridges. I want to teach you to use that gift on a cosmic scale."

    #"I'm honored by your trust in me."

            His hand briefly touches yours. "Rarer than you know."

        "It is," Izack acknowledges. "Inter-dimensional diplomacy can prevent wars... or accidentally start them. That's why training is essential. I won't send you into any situation you're not prepared for."

        *goto induction

    #"Will I get to visit other dimensions?"

Over the next week, Izack introduces you to the fundamentals of inter-dimensional diplomacy. You learn about the Dimensional Council—a loose coalition of realms committed to peaceful coexistence. You study the principles of cross-cultural communication, the nuances of magical protocols, the art of negotiation when parties don't even share the same concept of time.

"Every dimension has its own relationship with magic," Izack explains during one session, conjuring images of different magical systems. "Some see it as science, others as religion. Some channel it through technology, others through dance or song. Understanding these differences is crucial."

*set wisdom %+5
*set collaborative_magic %+5

You also learn about truth magic's role in diplomacy. Izack demonstrates the Oath Binding spell—a way to enforce agreements with magical certainty.

"This is why truth magic is so valuable in negotiations," he says as golden runes shimmer in the air between his hands. "When parties can bind their promises with magic, trust becomes tangible."

*set truth_magic %+10

*if (truth_magic >= 60)
    You find yourself naturally grasping the principles. The spell responds to your intent, golden light weaving between your fingers as you practice the binding patterns.

    "Excellent," Izack says with genuine pride. "You have real talent for this."

After a week of intensive study, Izack announces it's time for your first assignment.

"The best way to learn diplomacy is to practice it," Izack says, spreading three scrolls across his desk. "I have three situations that could use diplomatic intervention. Choose the one that interests you most."

He taps the first scroll. "The Lunar Realm and the Solar Court have been feuding for centuries over territorial boundaries. Both sides have requested a neutral mediator."

The second scroll glows with aquamarine light. "The Dimensional Council is holding its quarterly assembly. Avalon has a seat, and I'd like you to represent us. It's an excellent opportunity to build connections."

The third scroll shimmers with unknown colors. "We've established contact with a newly discovered realm—the Crystalline Expanse. They've expressed interest in a formal treaty with Avalon. First contact diplomacy is delicate but rewarding."

        "First contact," Izack's eyes light up. "There's something special about being among the first to establish relations with a new realm. The treaty you negotiate will shape their relationship with the wider dimensional community."

The Lunar Realm materializes around you in a wash of silver light. You and Izack stand in a garden of luminescent flowers that bloom only in moonlight. Across from you, representatives from both realms eye each other with barely concealed hostility.

Lady Celestine of the Lunar Realm is tall and elegant, with skin that seems to glow from within. Lord Radiance of the Solar Court blazes with golden intensity, his very presence radiating heat.

"Thank you for coming," Lady Celestine says coldly. "Though I doubt even Avalon's influence can make this one see reason."

"Reason?" Lord Radiance's voice crackles. "You speak of reason while your realm encroaches on territory that has been ours for millennia!"

*set empathy %+5

You feel the tension crackling between them. Izack catches your eye, giving you a subtle nod—this is your assignment. He's here to support, but you must lead.

        You raise a hand gently. "Before we discuss solutions, I'd like to understand the full situation. Lady Celestine, would you explain your realm's position?"

        Over the next hour, you listen carefully as each side presents their case. Lady Celestine describes how the Solar Court's expansion has disrupted delicate ecosystems that depend on moonlight. Lord Radiance counters that the Lunar Realm has been using subtle magic to extend their influence into neutral zones.

        By listening without judgment, you begin to see the real issue—both realms are growing, and the boundaries established centuries ago no longer fit current realities.

        "I see the problem," you say finally. "The old borders no longer serve either of your needs."

        Both representatives pause, surprised to hear their unspoken frustration articulated.

        "What if we established a shared zone?" you suggest. "Territory that both realms could access, with carefully negotiated terms of use?"

        Lady Celestine frowns. "We've tried shared arrangements before. They never work."

        Lord Radiance crosses his arms. "I agree with my lunar colleague for once. Shared sovereignty leads to constant friction."

        Izack touches your elbow gently. "Listen first," he murmurs. "Understand before proposing solutions."

        You realize you've moved too quickly, trying to solve the problem before fully understanding it.

            You channel truth magic carefully, golden light forming a subtle aura around the conversation. "I propose we ground this discussion in verifiable facts. With your permission, I'd like to use truth magic to confirm the historical and current boundaries."

            Both representatives exchange glances, then nod. In the presence of truth magic, exaggerations and misunderstandings quickly fall away. You discover that many of their grievances are based on incomplete information—territorial changes neither side actually caused, but both assumed the other had.

            "It seems," you say carefully, "that some of your conflicts may be based on misunderstandings rather than malicious actions."

            The revelation shifts the atmosphere immediately. It's easier to negotiate with someone when you realize they're not actually your enemy.

            You attempt to channel truth magic, but your control isn't refined enough for diplomatic work. The spell flickers and fades, making both representatives uncomfortable.

            "Perhaps we should stick to traditional negotiation," Izack suggests smoothly, stepping in to salvage the situation.

    After hours of careful negotiation, you help both sides reach an agreement. The new treaty establishes updated boundaries that accommodate both realms' growth, with buffer zones where both lunar and solar magic can coexist.

    When Lord Radiance and Lady Celestine shake hands—the first friendly contact between their realms in decades—you feel a profound sense of accomplishment.

    "Remarkable," Izack says later as you return to Avalon. "You prevented a conflict that could have escalated for generations."

    Despite your efforts, the negotiations stall. Neither side is willing to compromise, and eventually both representatives leave without agreement.

    You feel disappointed, but Izack places a reassuring hand on your shoulder. "Your first mediation is always difficult," he says. "But you've learned valuable lessons about preparation and patience."

The Dimensional Council meets in a space that exists between dimensions—a vast hall where walls shimmer with portals to dozens of different realms. Representatives from across the multiverse gather in a spectacular display of diversity.

You see beings of pure energy conversing with crystalline entities, shadow-wreathed diplomats comparing notes with representatives who appear as living gardens. The sheer variety is overwhelming.

"Stay close," Izack murmurs. "Council politics can be complex. Your goal today is to observe, make connections, and represent Avalon's interests."

The council session covers various inter-dimensional matters—trade agreements, magical research collaborations, disputes over dimensional boundaries. You watch carefully, learning the subtle dynamics of who holds influence, who forms alliances, who harbors old grudges.

During a recess, several representatives approach you.

*choice
    #Focus on meeting representatives from magical realms
        *set dimensional_magic %+5
        *set collaborative_magic %+5
        You gravitate toward representatives from highly magical dimensions. Ambassador Crystallia of the Gem Realms shares insights about crystalline spellcasting. Archon Shadowmere discusses shadow magic's diplomatic applications—using darkness to create private spaces for sensitive negotiations.

        "You're from Avalon?" asks a being wreathed in rainbow light. "I'm Envoy Prismata. We've long admired your school's approach to truth magic."

        You spend the next hour in fascinating discussions about magical theory across dimensions. Several representatives express interest in establishing formal exchanges with Avalon.

    #Connect with representatives from non-magical realms
        *set empathy %+5
        *set wisdom %+5
        You seek out representatives from dimensions with little or no inherent magic. Ambassador Chen represents a realm where magic is achieved through technology and scientific understanding. Delegate Torres comes from a dimension where magic is rare and often feared.

        "It's refreshing to meet someone from a magical realm who doesn't assume superiority," Torres says. "Too many Council members forget that different doesn't mean lesser."

        These conversations give you valuable perspective on how magic appears to those outside its embrace. You learn about the challenges non-magical realms face in a Council dominated by magical perspectives.

        You move through the gathering systematically, introducing yourself to representatives from all types of dimensions. You listen more than you speak, asking thoughtful questions and finding common ground.

        By the end of the recess, you've made genuine connections with delegates from over a dozen realms. Several mention they'll remember Avalon's representative who actually took time to understand their concerns.

When the Council reconvenes, a contentious issue arises—a proposal to restrict certain types of dimensional travel. The debate grows heated, with magical realms generally supporting restriction and non-magical realms opposing it.

Izack leans toward you. "Avalon's vote will matter here. What's your recommendation?"

*choice
    #Support the restrictions (magical realms)
        *set wisdom %+3
        You vote to support measured restrictions, arguing that some dimensional travel can be destabilizing. The magical realm representatives nod approvingly, and several thank you afterward.

        However, you notice some representatives from non-magical realms looking disappointed.

        *goto council_end

    #Oppose the restrictions (non-magical realms)
        *set empathy %+3
        You vote against the restrictions, arguing that limiting dimensional travel limits understanding and cooperation. The non-magical realm representatives express gratitude for Avalon's support.

        Some magical realm representatives seem less pleased, though they respect your position.

        You raise your hand and address the Council. "What if, instead of blanket restrictions, we establish a voluntary registry system? Realms concerned about certain types of dimensional travel could register their preferences, while maintaining overall freedom of movement."

        The hall falls quiet as representatives consider your proposal. Then Ambassador Crystallia speaks: "This honors both security concerns and freedom of movement. I support this amendment."

        Delegate Torres nods. "As do we. This is exactly the kind of bridge-building the Council needs."

        Your compromise passes with overwhelming support. As the session ends, numerous representatives approach to congratulate Avalon's delegation on finding common ground.

        "Well done," Izack says quietly, pride evident in his voice. "That's what diplomacy looks like."

The portal to the Crystalline Expanse opens with a sound like wind chimes. You step through with Izack into a world that defies description.

Everything here is alive with geometry and light. Crystal formations grow and shift like living things, resonating with mathematical precision. The inhabitants are crystalline beings, their bodies formed from interlocking geometric shapes that refract rainbow light.

"Welcome," chimes a voice that seems to come from all directions. A being of extraordinary complexity materializes before you—Ambassador Facet, as they introduce themselves.

"This realm is unlike anything I've seen," you breathe.

Izack smiles. "First contact is always extraordinary. Remember—assume nothing, observe everything, and show respect for differences."

Over the next several days, you work on negotiating a formal treaty between Avalon and the Crystalline Expanse. The process is fascinating and challenging—the crystalline beings think in patterns and harmonies, their very language based on resonance and frequency.

        You propose that the treaty emphasize magical knowledge sharing. The crystalline beings teach you about geometric spellcasting—magic based on perfect mathematical forms.

        In return, you share principles of truth magic. Ambassador Facet is particularly fascinated by how Avalon uses magic to ensure honesty and binding agreements.

        "Harmonious," they chime. "Truth as frequency, honesty as resonance. This we understand."

        You suggest the treaty focus on deeper understanding between your peoples. This includes student exchanges, cultural ambassadors, and collaborative study programs.

        The crystalline beings resonate with approval. "Growth through understanding," Ambassador Facet chimes. "This aligns with our core frequency."

        They offer to teach selected Avalon students their meditation techniques—ways of achieving perfect mental clarity through geometric visualization.

        You work carefully to create a treaty that covers all aspects of inter-dimensional relations—magical exchange, cultural understanding, trade agreements, and mutual defense provisions.

        It takes longer to negotiate, but the result is a robust framework that will serve both Avalon and the Crystalline Expanse for generations.

        Ambassador Facet's crystalline form pulses with complex patterns. "Complete harmony," they chime. "All frequencies aligned. This is unprecedented in our first contact protocols."

Several weeks into your diplomatic training, Izack announces a special opportunity.

"True diplomacy requires more than negotiation skills," he says. "You must understand other cultures deeply, from within. I've arranged for you to spend time in a dimension very different from our own."

He opens a portal to the Twilight Gardens—a realm where day and night exist simultaneously, where magic flows through living things in visible streams of light.

"Live here for a week," Izack instructs. "Learn their customs, their magic, their way of seeing reality. This is cultural immersion."

*set empathy %+10
*set dimensional_magic %+10

The Twilight Gardens are breathtaking. You stay with a local family who teach you their traditions—how they cultivate magic through meditation among bioluminescent flowers, how they resolve disputes through ritual dances, how they see time as circular rather than linear.

    #Fully embrace their customs and traditions
        *set empathy %+10
        *set wisdom %+5
        You throw yourself into the experience, adopting their practices completely. You dress in their style, eat their food, participate in their rituals. Some practices feel strange at first, but you approach everything with openness and respect.

        By the end of the week, you've begun to understand their perspective from within. When you attend a dispute resolution dance, you can feel the emotional logic of it—how movement and rhythm communicate what words cannot.

        "You have a gift for cultural adaptation," your host family tells you. "Your empathy allows you to see through others' eyes."

        They teach you a spell unique to their realm—Twilight Harmony, which allows you to perceive emotional resonance in any environment.

        You participate respectfully in the Twilight Gardens customs while maintaining your own identity. You're a visitor, learning but not pretending to be something you're not.

        This honesty earns respect. "You honor us by learning," your host says, "and honor yourself by remaining authentic. This is the mark of a true diplomat."

        They offer to teach you a spell from their tradition—Emotional Clarity, which allows you to sense the true feelings beneath spoken words.

        Some of their customs are difficult for you to understand or accept. The circular view of time feels disorienting. Some of their rituals seem inefficient to your linear mind.

        You try your best, but there's an awkwardness to your participation. Your hosts are patient and kind, but you can tell you're missing something essential.

        On your last day, the eldest of your host family sits with you. "Cultural understanding is not easy," they say gently. "Some barriers take time to cross. What matters is that you tried, that you showed respect even in confusion."

        They give you a small token—a flower that glows with twilight—and wish you well on your diplomatic journey.

When you return to Avalon, you're changed by the experience. You've seen reality through fundamentally different eyes, and it's expanded your understanding of what's possible.

"Cultural immersion is the heart of diplomacy," Izack says when you debrief. "You can't truly negotiate with people you don't understand. And you can't understand them without experiencing their world."

*if (izack_romance = true)
    He studies you with those silver eyes. "You've grown remarkably. Not just in skill, but in depth of character."

    There's warmth in his voice that makes your heart skip.

Your growing reputation as a diplomat leads to your most challenging assignment yet. Izack summons you urgently to the Diplomatic Wing.

"We have a crisis," he says, his expression grave. "Negotiations between the Storm Realm and the Forest Dimension have completely broken down. They're on the verge of war."

*set empathy %+5

He shows you the situation: The Storm Realm claims the Forest Dimension has been using weather magic to steal their rain. The Forest Dimension counters that the Storm Realm's aggressive expansion has disrupted natural weather patterns. Both sides have mobilized military forces.

"They've requested one final attempt at negotiation," Izack explains. "But emotions are running so high that even experienced diplomats have failed. I think you might succeed where others haven't—your gift for empathy, for truly listening to people."

        *set empathy %+3
        Izack's expression softens. "Because I've watched you grow. I've seen how you connect with people, how you find common ground where others see only conflict. You have something that can't be taught—genuine compassion."

The emergency negotiation takes place in a neutral dimensional space—a bare room with only a table and chairs. King Tempest of the Storm Realm crackles with barely contained fury, lightning flickering across his form. Queen Verdant of the Forest Dimension radiates cold anger, thorny vines writhing around her crown.

The moment you enter, both begin shouting over each other.

"—stealing our life's blood, our very rain!"
"—disrupting patterns that have existed for millennia!"

*set empathy %+5

The raw emotion in the room is overwhelming. You can feel their rage, their fear, their sense of betrayal. This isn't just politics—both leaders believe their realms' very survival is at stake.

        You don't try to interrupt. You simply listen, giving each leader space to express their full fury and frustration. King Tempest rages about droughts and dying storms. Queen Verdant describes forests withering, rivers running dry.

        After nearly an hour, the shouting gradually subsides. In the exhausted silence that follows, you speak quietly:

        "You're both afraid. Afraid your realms are dying, and that the other is responsible."

        Both leaders look at you, surprised that someone has truly heard them.

        "But what if," you continue carefully, "neither of you is causing the other's problems? What if there's a third factor you haven't considered?"

        King Tempest frowns. "What do you mean?"

        Using truth magic to verify your findings, you present research Izack helped you prepare—evidence that a distant dimensional anomaly has been affecting weather patterns across multiple realms, including theirs.

        "You're not enemies," you say gently. "You're both victims of the same problem. And if you work together, you might be able to solve it."

        The atmosphere shifts dramatically. Anger transforms into thoughtful consideration.

        "And don't expect me to sit quietly while he makes false accusations!" Queen Verdant snaps.

        The shouting intensifies. Your attempt to impose structure has only made them angrier.

            You close your eyes and extend your awareness, using your empathetic gifts to truly feel what both leaders are experiencing.

            Beneath King Tempest's rage is terror—he's watching his realm's fundamental nature fade, storms weakening, his people losing their identity. Under Queen Verdant's cold anger is grief—ancient trees dying, ecosystems collapsing, irreplaceable beauty disappearing.

            Both are lashing out because they're desperate and scared.

            You open your eyes. "King Tempest, you fear that if the storms die, your realm loses its essence. Queen Verdant, you grieve every forest that withers, feeling each loss personally."

            Both leaders freeze, shocked that someone has articulated their deepest fears.

            "You see each other as enemies," you continue gently, "but you're both fighting the same battle—to preserve what you love against forces that seem overwhelming."

            In the silence that follows, something shifts. They look at each other with new understanding.

    When Queen Verdant and King Tempest shake hands, there's hope in their eyes instead of hatred.

    News of your success spreads rapidly. You prevented an inter-dimensional war through empathy and skillful negotiation.

Near the end of your second year, Izack proposes an ambitious project.

"You've learned about diplomacy, negotiation, cultural exchange," he says, silver eyes gleaming with excitement. "Now I want to teach you about collaborative magic on a scale rarely attempted—magic that requires coordination across multiple dimensions."

He explains his vision: a summit bringing together magical practitioners from different realms to jointly cast a spell addressing a shared problem—the dimensional instability that's been causing weather disruptions, territorial shifts, and other problems across multiple dimensions.

"This will require everything you've learned," Izack continues. "Diplomatic coordination, cultural sensitivity, magical skill, and trust-building across boundaries."

*set collaborative_magic %+15
*set dimensional_magic %+10

Over the next few weeks, you help organize the summit. You reach out to your network of contacts, negotiating terms that will make everyone comfortable participating. You coordinate with representatives from over twenty dimensions.

The summit itself is breathtaking. In a specially prepared chamber at Avalon, magical practitioners from across the multiverse gather. You see crystalline mages next to shadow weavers, storm callers conversing with forest druids, technomancers comparing notes with traditional spellcasters.

            With Izack's guidance, you take the central position in the casting circle. Your role is to coordinate the different magical traditions, harmonizing their diverse approaches into unified purpose.

            It's the most complex magic you've ever attempted. You must hold space for crystalline geometry, shadow manipulation, weather magic, growth magic, and a dozen other traditions simultaneously.

            But your diplomatic training serves you well. Just as you've learned to find common ground between different cultures, you find the common threads between different magical systems.

            The spell builds like a symphony, each tradition contributing its unique voice to a harmonious whole. When the magic finally releases, it ripples out across dimensions, stabilizing the anomalies that have been causing so many problems.

            The chamber erupts in celebration. You've just participated in—and led—one of the most ambitious collaborative magical workings in dimensional history.

            "Extraordinary," Izack breathes. "You've proven that cooperation across dimensions isn't just diplomatic theory. It's practical magic."

            You learn several collaborative spells from the experience:

            You take the central position, but the complexity quickly overwhelms you. Coordinating so many different magical traditions requires more raw power and control than you currently possess.

            You struggle to hold the casting together, and it begins to fracture.

            Izack smoothly steps in, taking over the coordination. "Support me," he murmurs. "Feel how the different magics interweave."

            From your new position, you learn by observation. Watching Izack harmonize dozens of magical traditions teaches you volumes about collaborative magic.

            The spell succeeds, though you feel disappointed you couldn't lead it yourself.

            "There's no shame in recognizing your current limits," Izack tells you afterward. "You'll be ready to lead workings like this in time. Today, you learned by participating."

        You ensure everyone feels included and respected. When tensions arise between participants with historical conflicts, you mediate. When someone's uncomfortable with the format, you help adapt it to accommodate their tradition.

        Your diplomatic work is what makes the magical work possible. Izack harmonizes the spells, but you harmonize the people.

        The casting succeeds magnificently, and afterward, numerous participants specifically thank you for creating an environment where such collaboration felt safe and possible.

        "Different kinds of power," Izack tells you with approval. "You're learning to use yours wisely."

One evening, after the summit celebrations have ended, Izack invites you to his private study. You've rarely been here—it's his sanctuary, lined with books and artifacts from countless dimensions.

He pours tea and you sit together in comfortable silence for a moment before he speaks.

"Do you understand now why I do this?" he asks. "Why I built Avalon, why I dedicate myself to training diplomats, why inter-dimensional cooperation matters so deeply to me?"

        He leans forward intently. "Most people see their own dimension as separate, isolated. But reality is a web, not a collection of islands. What happens in one dimension ripples through others. We're connected whether we acknowledge it or not."

[b]== THE WARRIOR'S PATH ==[/b]

*line_break

The training grounds stretch before you—vast circles of combat magic, protective wards glowing in defensive patterns, and students practicing battle techniques under the watchful eyes of experienced combat mages.

This is your home now.

*page_break

Zara waits at the center of the largest training circle, her hybrid features bright with anticipation. The Defender's Mark on your arm pulses in response to her presence—you're connected now, student and mentor, through the ancient bond of warriors.

*line_break

[i]"Ready to learn how to kick dimensional threats in their theoretical faces?"[/i] Polly asks cheerfully. [i]"Because that's basically what combat magic is—extremely aggressive problem-solving."[/i]

[b]FIRST TRAINING SESSION: BATTLE MAGIC FUNDAMENTALS[/b]

*line_break

"Alright, combat students!" Zara's voice carries authority tempered with warmth. "Year One taught you control, precision, and collaboration. Year Two teaches you to use those skills when something's trying to kill you."

*page_break

She gestures, and a shimmering construct materializes—roughly humanoid, made of dimensional energy, clearly hostile.

*line_break

"This is a training construct. It won't actually hurt you, but it [i]will[/i] try its hardest. Your first lesson: defensive response under pressure."

*page_break

The construct lunges toward a nervous student. They panic, throwing up a hasty shield that shatters on impact. The construct dissipates—the test failed, but the student unharmed.

*line_break

Zara nods. "Fear breaks concentration. In combat, you can't afford that. ${name}, you're next."

*page_break

Another construct materializes, and this one is looking right at you.

*line_break

*choice
  #Stand my ground and form a solid defensive barrier.
    *set power +5
    *set combat_performance +2

    You plant your feet and channel your training. The barrier forms—not flashy, but solid. When the construct strikes, your shield holds.

    *line_break

    "Good!" Zara calls. "Defense first. Always."

    *goto combat_lesson_continues

  #Dodge and counter with offensive magic.
    *set power +5
    *set combat_performance +1

    You sidestep the construct's lunge and fire a bolt of concentrated magic. It strikes true, dispersing the construct instantly.

    *line_break

    "Effective," Zara says, "but risky. What if you'd missed?"

    *goto combat_lesson_continues

  #Try to understand the construct's energy pattern first.
    *set knowledge +5
    *set combat_performance +3

    You don't immediately defend or attack. Instead, you observe—reading the construct's magical signature, understanding its limitations.

    *line_break

    Then you adjust your shield's frequency to specifically counter its energy type. When it strikes, it can't even touch your barrier.

    *line_break

    Zara's expression shifts to impressed. "Now [i]that's[/i] combat intelligence. Anyone can throw power around. Smart fighters adapt."

    *goto combat_lesson_continues

*label combat_lesson_continues

*page_break

Over the next several hours, Zara pushes you through increasingly difficult scenarios:

*line_break

Multiple constructs attacking simultaneously.
Defensive magic while maintaining awareness of allies.
Combat casting under time pressure.
Tactical positioning in three-dimensional space.

By the end of the session, you're exhausted but exhilarated.

  She steps closer, and you notice her hand brushing yours—not quite accidental.

[b]CHOOSING YOUR COMBAT SPECIALIZATION[/b]

*line_break

Zara leads you to a chamber lined with three distinct training areas, each one resonating with different combat energy.

*page_break

"Every combat mage develops a specialization," she explains. "It shapes how you fight, what techniques you master, and what role you'll play in battle teams."

*line_break

She gestures to the three areas:

*page_break

[b]OFFENSIVE MAGIC[/b] - The first area crackles with destructive power. Fire, lightning, force—raw damage channeled with precision.

*line_break

"Offensive specialists are our heavy hitters," Zara explains. "You'll learn destruction magic, elemental combat, and how to eliminate threats quickly. High damage, high risk."

*page_break

[b]DEFENSIVE MAGIC[/b] - The second area glows with protective wards. Shields, barriers, dimensional anchoring—magic that protects and endures.

*line_break

"Defensive specialists keep everyone alive," Zara says. "You'll master shields, protective barriers, and dimensional stabilization. You'll be the wall between danger and your team."

*page_break

[b]TACTICAL MAGIC[/b] - The third area shimmers with complexity. Portals, terrain manipulation, support magic—combat through strategic advantage.

*line_break

"Tactical specialists control the battlefield," Zara continues. "You'll learn portal creation, environmental manipulation, and combat support. You won't deal the most damage, but you'll determine who wins."

*page_break

"Each path teaches different spells and techniques," Zara says. "Choose based on your strengths and what feels right."

  #Throw it at the training target with full power.
    *set power +5

    You hurl the lance. It strikes the target dead center and [i]explodes[/i], reducing the magical construct to scattered energy.

She demonstrates a spell—[b]Dimensional Anchor[/b]—a protective ward that stabilizes reality itself, preventing hostile teleportation or dimensional manipulation.

*page_break

"Feel the boundaries around you. Not to break them—to [i]strengthen[/i] them. Make reality itself your shield."

*line_break

You extend your awareness to the dimensional membrane surrounding you. It feels fragile, full of weak points. You reach out and—

She demonstrates a spell—[b]Minor Portal[/b]—creating a small dimensional gateway that can redirect attacks, reposition allies, or create strategic advantages.

*page_break

"Combat isn't just about power—it's about positioning. A portal in the right place can change everything."

*line_break

You focus on the space around you, feeling where the dimensional fabric is weakest, where reality would accept a controlled tear. You reach out and—

A shimmering portal opens, stable and responsive to your will.

    You don't stop at one portal. You create a second, linking them—anyone stepping through one would emerge from the other.

[b]CRISIS: THE BREACH[/b]

*line_break

Three days after the tournament, the alarm rings.

*page_break

It's not a drill. You can tell from the way the dimensional boundaries [i]scream[/i]—something is forcing its way through Avalon's defenses.

*line_break

[i]"All combat students to defensive positions!"[/i] Zara's voice echoes through magical amplification. [i]"This is real! Dimensional creatures are breaching the eastern boundary!"[/i]

You grab your combat gear and run.

*line_break

*set stress +20

The eastern boundary is chaos. Dimensional rifts tear open the sky, and through them pour creatures that shouldn't exist—writhing masses of impossible geometry, beings made of hungry shadows, constructs of pure dimensional instability.

*page_break

Aria and Zara are already there, holding the primary breach point. But smaller breaches are opening all along the boundary.

*line_break

"Combat students!" Zara shouts. "Teams of three! Seal the smaller breaches!"

  You cast Barrier Sphere—a massive protective dome covering the entire dormitory. The creatures slam against your shield, but it holds.

  "Everyone inside!" you shout. "Get to safety!"

  Your shields protect dozens of students while other combat mages systematically eliminate the creatures. You hold the barrier for fifteen excruciating minutes—longer than any second-year student should be capable of.

  *page_break

  When the last creature falls and you finally drop the shields, you collapse from exhaustion. But every student is safe.

  Later, those students will remember: when danger came, you stood between them and death.

  You fight desperately, using every spell you know to eliminate creatures before they reach the younger students.

You arrive just as one tears through a shelf of dimensional theory texts.

*page_break

Aria is there, fighting with devastating precision, but she's protecting scholars and can't pursue the creatures deeper into the library.

  Each creature falls before it can destroy irreplaceable knowledge. Your offensive specialization makes you a perfect hunter in these confined spaces.

Zara fights at the breach point, her hybrid magic blazing with unprecedented power. But she's being pushed back.

*page_break

You don't think. You just act.

*line_break

  You create portals around the breach—not to close it, but to redirect the creatures' momentum. They emerge from your portals disoriented, off-balance.

  "Brilliant!" Zara shouts. She uses the advantage you've created, striking down creatures that can't defend themselves.

  Together, you create a devastating synergy. Your tactical magic and her combat mastery combine into something greater than either of you alone.

  *page_break

  When Aria finally seals the main breach, both you and Zara are standing at the epicenter, surrounded by the dissolved remains of dozens of creatures.

  "You saved my life," Zara says quietly, after. "And probably dozens of others."

  *goto breach_sealed

The breach crisis lasts three hours. By the end, every student in the Combat Path has faced real danger and survived.

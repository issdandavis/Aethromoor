Where once it questioned your presence, examined your worthiness, now it simply [i]welcomes[/i]. The dimensional boundary parts like greeting an old friend—because that's what you are. Part of Avalon's living memory. Woven into its very essence.

Two years ago, you arrived as a nervous first-year, portal-sick and uncertain.

Today, you return as something else entirely.

Your quarters have transformed again.

The training grounds are empty except for you and Zara. She's already in combat stance, grinning.

[b]"Assessment first, talking second. Show me what you learned over summer. Don't hold back—I can take it!"[/b]

*page_break

You spend the next twenty minutes demonstrating your combat techniques. Defensive wards, offensive magic, tactical positioning, crisis response. Zara matches you move for move, pushing you harder, testing your limits.

Finally, she calls a halt.

  She's beaming with genuine pride.

  [b]"I want you to co-teach the second-year combat sessions. You're skilled enough to train others. Plus, teaching reinforces your own learning."[/b]
*elseif power >= 55
  [b]"Solid work! Your technique has improved a lot. You're confident, capable, and you handle pressure well."[/b]

  She steps closer, her professional demeanor cracking into something warmer.

  [b]"And hey—I know I'm supposed to be all professional advisor right now, but I just want to say I'm really proud of you. Watching you grow these past two years has been amazing."[/b]

  *line_break

  A quick, almost shy smile.

  [b]"Also you look great. The training definitely agrees with you. Is that inappropriate to mention? Probably. I said it anyway!"[/b]

The Dream Gardens bloom around you as you walk with Izack. Flowers respond to your presence—you've been here so many times over two years that the gardens recognize you, opening in patterns of welcome.

*page_break

[b]"Two years ago,"[/b] Izack begins softly, [b]"you chose the diplomatic path. At the time, I wondered if you fully understood what that meant—the emotional labor, the constant mediation, the weight of representing Avalon to other realms."[/b]

He turns to face you.

  [b]"You have exceeded every expectation. Your ability to understand others, to build bridges between different perspectives, to negotiate solutions that honor all parties—it's remarkable, ${name}."[/b]

  *line_break

  His smile is genuinely proud.

  [b]"I'm authorizing you to conduct autonomous diplomatic missions this year. You'll represent Avalon in other realms, negotiate agreements, mediate disputes—all without constant supervision."[/b]
*elseif empathy >= 55
  [b]"You have developed well. Your empathy and communication skills have grown significantly. You understand the principles of collaborative diplomacy."[/b]

  *line_break

  [b]"This year, you'll accompany me on diplomatic missions to other realms. You'll observe, assist, and gradually take more active roles in negotiations."[/b]
*else
  [b]"You have potential, but diplomacy requires deeper emotional intelligence. You sometimes still approach problems from a purely strategic perspective rather than truly understanding all parties' needs."[/b]

  [b]"Year Three will focus on developing your empathy and communication. More intensive training, more complex scenarios, more attention to emotional nuance."[/b]

*page_break

*if izack_romance = true
  He reaches out, gently touching your hand—a gesture brief enough to be deniable, but clearly intentional.

  [b]"${name}, I want to be clear: my assessment of your diplomatic abilities is entirely professional. What I feel for you personally doesn't influence my evaluation of your skills."[/b]

  *line_break

  A pause, then softer:

The leylines flow visible beneath the academy's surface—rivers of pure magical potential.

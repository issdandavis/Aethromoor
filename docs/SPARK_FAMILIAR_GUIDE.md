# Spark Familiar Guide

## Overview

The **Spark** familiar is a new companion option available in Polly's Wingscroll: The First Thread. This fire elemental familiar offers players a unique magical partner focused on transformation, creativity, and elemental power.

## What is the Spark Familiar?

Spark is a dancing flame with bright eyes, crackling with warmth and boundless energy. Unlike traditional familiars, Spark represents pure elemental fire—not destructive, but transformative and energizing.

## How to Choose Spark

During the **Familiar Selection** scene at the beginning of the game:

1. When presented with five familiar options, choose: **"Welcome the dancing flame"**
2. You'll then be able to name your flame familiar:
   - **Spark** - Boosts Power (+5) and Creativity (+3)
   - **Ember** - Boosts Empathy (+3) and Collaboration (+3)
   - **Ignis** - Boosts Power (+3) and Knowledge (+3)

## Lore and Philosophy

Spark represents the philosophy that fire is fundamentally about transformation and honesty:
- **Transformation**: Fire changes everything it touches, just as learning changes the learner
- **Honesty**: Fire shows exactly what it is—no pretense, pure energy
- **Warmth**: Comfort and connection without possession
- **Movement**: Constant change and adaptation

Polly's observation: *"Fire's always been honest. It shows you exactly what it is—no pretense, just pure energy. Quite refreshing, really."*

2. **Sensory Details**: Include what characters see, hear, feel (magical tingles, dimensional pressure)

3. **Living Magic**: Magic should feel alive - robes moving, air humming, light pulsing

4. **Character Through Description**: Izack's ink-stained fingers show his scholarly nature

5. **Consistent Details**: Always mention key features (Izack's robes, Aria's wards, Zara's eyes)

6. **Magical Realism**: Treat impossible things as normal (floating books, shifting architecture)

7. **Emotional Resonance**: Link descriptions to feelings (warm welcome, dangerous power, ancient wisdom)

## Example Passages

### Izack Introduction (Good Example):
"Izack Thorne stands in the courtyard—and he's exactly as the stories described yet somehow more. Tall and lean at over six feet, his dark skin seems to glow faintly in Avalon's magical ambiance. His shoulder-length hair is wild and dark, touched with silver at the temples as if static electricity constantly runs through it, responding to the dimensional currents he commands. When his amber eyes meet yours, they seem to shift—deepening to gold, flickering with star-flecks that suggest he's seeing not just you, but all the possible yous across nearby timelines."

### Magical Environment (Good Example):
"The entrance is a magnificent archway carved from living crystal—each facet pulses with soft amber light, responding to the presence of seekers. Through it, you see endless rows of shelves that seem to curve upward into impossible geometries, defying Euclidean space with casual confidence."

### Creature Encounter (Good Example):
"The Melodrake itself is magnificent—serpentine body covered in scales that shimmer like musical notes made solid. Wings that hum even when folded. It's currently curled in a corner, making low, discordant sounds."

# Playthrough Blueprints (CoG-Scale)

These four routes target 150k–200k words with ~60–70 scenes (Choice of the Vampire/Life of a Wizard scale) and map to positive/negative collaboration arcs. Each blueprint lists required scenes, recurring choice loops, mechanics to emphasize, lore pulls for sourcing, and GitHub task markers for stage milestones.

## Route 1: Leyline Accord (Positive Collaboration Arc)
- **Scope:** Cooperative crescendo that proves collaboration amplifies Avalon’s sentience; 60–65 scenes across academy years, expeditions, and post-grad fallout.
- **Required scenes:**
  - Academy resonance labs in the Spiral Spire and Leyline Gazebo to teach collaborative magic as conversation with Avalon’s sentient leylines.【F:lore/Pollys_Wingscrolls_Worldbuilding.markdown†L5-L29】
  - Field practicum in the Verdant Tithe and Shardfold Coast showing ecological stakes of teamwork and memory-rich flora/fauna.【F:lore/Pollys_Wingscrolls_Worldbuilding.markdown†L70-L105】
  - Dimensional Fringe synthesis where joint spellwork stabilizes foldpoints and the Spiral Nexus during crisis.【F:lore/Pollys_Wingscrolls_Worldbuilding.markdown†L137-L165】
- **Choice loops:**
  - Weekly guild council where players broker compromises between Elementalists, Diplomancers, and Runic Engineers (collaboration meter vs. personal power).
  - Expedition prep loops that trade spell slots for logistics (resources vs. safety) before heading into wild-magic zones.
  - Romance feedback loops with Izack/Aria that mirror collaboration style; supportive paths unlock combined rituals.【F:lore/# IZACK'S MAGICAL UNIVERSE - COMPLE.txt†L38-L49】
- **Mechanics focus:** Shared-cast bonuses, co-op spell failure risk, romance synergy tests, resource trade-offs (wealth/fame/happiness) tied to public perception of collaboration.【F:documentation/GAME_STATUS.md†L13-L32】
- **Lore pulls:** Avalon’s sentient infrastructure and collaborative spell traits; Verdant Tithe memory magic; Spiral Nexus conditions.【F:lore/Pollys_Wingscrolls_Worldbuilding.markdown†L5-L165】

  - [ ] Testing — label: `qa`, milestone: `testing`

## Route 2: Fractured Choir (Positive → Negative Collaboration Collapse)
- **Scope:** Starts harmonious, fractures under pressure; 65–70 scenes that track erosion of trust and competing agendas.
- **Required scenes:**
  - Early co-authored research at Avalon’s Floating Isles and Dream Gardens showing idealistic teamwork before cracks form.【F:lore/Pollys_Wingscrolls_Worldbuilding.markdown†L11-L35】
  - Diplomatic summit in Viremont and Sul’dessar where factional debts and broken oaths strain alliances.【F:lore/Pollys_Wingscrolls_Worldbuilding.markdown†L70-L104】
  - Descent into Varn’ka’zul where pact magic tempts party members into zero-sum bargains.【F:lore/Pollys_Wingscrolls_Worldbuilding.markdown†L106-L135】
- **Choice loops:**
  - Trust/betrayal loop in council debates—compromise, stall, or sideline rivals (affects crisis readiness).
  - Crisis rehearsal loops that can be sabotaged for personal gain, weakening combined spells.
  - Romance rupture loop where partners demand exclusivity or ideological alignment; failure flips them to rivals.【F:lore/# IZACK'S MAGICAL UNIVERSE - COMPLE.txt†L38-L65】
- **Mechanics focus:** Collaboration meter that can invert into rivalry penalties; pact-magic risk/reward; fame vs. integrity trade-offs; romance lockouts when trust breaks.【F:documentation/GAME_STATUS.md†L13-L32】
- **Lore pulls:** Floating Isles/Dream Gardens wonder, Viremont political wards, Sul’dessar oath-sands, and Varn’ka’zul pact mechanics.【F:lore/Pollys_Wingscrolls_Worldbuilding.markdown†L11-L135】
- **Stage milestones (GitHub tasks/labels):**

## Route 3: Resonance Merchants (Pragmatic Collaboration Arc)
- **Scope:** Neutral-to-positive arc about transactional alliances; 55–60 scenes centered on logistics, trade, and careful reciprocity.
- **Required scenes:**
  - Silverflow River convocation where mage guilds barter resources and spell-services, tying wealth/fame stakes to collaboration.【F:lore/Pollys_Wingscrolls_Worldbuilding.markdown†L42-L66】【F:documentation/GAME_STATUS.md†L13-L32}
  - Cross-biome caravans through Dremsreach and Verdant Tithe highlighting supply risks and mutual protection pacts.【F:lore/Pollys_Wingscrolls_Worldbuilding.markdown†L70-L105】
  - Spiral Nexus contract summit where shared logistics prevent foldpoint failures without full trust.【F:lore/Pollys_Wingscrolls_Worldbuilding.markdown†L137-L165】
- **Choice loops:**
  - Market cycles balancing coin, favors, and spell components; players can default, honor, or renegotiate.
  - Escort/convoy loops that swap romance time or personal study for group safety and profit.
  - Reputation loops that adjust prices and aid based on prior fairness (fame/happiness vs. wealth).
- **Mechanics focus:** Resource-trade subsystem tied to wealth/fame/happiness; limited-collab buffs; romance as business partnership with unique co-investment scenes.【F:documentation/GAME_STATUS.md†L13-L32】【F:lore/# IZACK'S MAGICAL UNIVERSE - COMPLE.txt†L38-L65】
- **Lore pulls:** Silverflow trade artery, Dremsreach hazards, Verdant Tithe memory-wood cargo, Spiral Nexus as neutral port of call.【F:lore/Pollys_Wingscrolls_Worldbuilding.markdown†L42-L165】

## Route 4: Broken Pact Spiral (Negative Collaboration Arc)
- **Scope:** Collaboration is weaponized and ultimately rejected; 60–65 scenes ending in hard-won independence or destructive isolation.
- **Required scenes:**
  - Pact-forging tutorial at the Citadel of Zul-Qa’ath teaching exploitative collaboration and its costs.【F:lore/Pollys_Wingscrolls_Worldbuilding.markdown†L106-L135】
  - Memory-warp expedition in Dremsreach where teammates rewrite agreements mid-mission, forcing betrayals.【F:lore/Pollys_Wingscrolls_Worldbuilding.markdown†L70-L105】
  - Final choice at the Spiral Nexus: sever anchors to stop contract contagion or submit to recursive control.【F:lore/Pollys_Wingscrolls_Worldbuilding.markdown†L137-L165】
- **Choice loops:**
  - Contract escalation loop: accept harsher terms for short-term power vs. preserving autonomy.
  - Loyalty audits where party members test promises; failures trigger curses or companion departures.
  - Romance ultimatum loop where partners insist on pact terms that may void collaboration perks.【F:lore/# IZACK'S MAGICAL UNIVERSE - COMPLE.txt†L38-L65】
- **Mechanics focus:** Inverted collaboration meter that grants power but stacks corruption; resource drains tied to breach penalties; romance as leverage; fame plummets as betrayal spreads.【F:documentation/GAME_STATUS.md†L13-L32】
- **Lore pulls:** Infernal contracts of Varn’ka’zul, Dremsreach’s time-warps, Spiral Nexus fragility under pact recursion.【F:lore/Pollys_Wingscrolls_Worldbuilding.markdown†L70-L165】

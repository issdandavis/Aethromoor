# Tracing & Analytics Guide

This guide explains the lightweight tracing added to the **HTML game** (`game/`) and how to extend similar concepts to the **ChoiceScript** version.

## What Was Added
New file: `game/tracing.js` and instrumentation in `game/game.js`:
- `init` – game session start
- `node_displayed` – each story node shown
- `choice_made` – player choice + stat deltas
- `ending_reached` – ending node with full path & final stats
- `game_restarted` – player restarts
- `trace_reset` – manual trace clear via `clearTrace()`

All events accumulate in `window.gameTrace.events` with timestamps.

## Accessing Trace Data
Open browser dev tools (F12) while playing:
```js
window.exportTrace(); // Returns JSON string of full trace
window.gameTrace;     // Inspect live object
window.clearTrace();  // Reset (records trace_reset event)
```

## Event Payloads
- `node_displayed`: `{ node, collaborationScore, relationships }`
- `choice_made`: `{ fromNode, choiceText, effects, updatedCollaboration, relationships }`
- `ending_reached`: `{ ending, collaborationScore, relationships, path }` where `path` is an array of `{ node, choice }` pairs

## Use Cases
- Balance Collaboration progression curves (compare typical paths vs extremes)
- Detect low-impact choices (effects = `{}`) for future tuning
- Verify endings reached match `README.md` / design docs (14 endings parity)
- Feed anonymized paths into stat modeling or playtest analytics

## Multi-AI Workflow Integration
| Role | Trace Usage |
|------|-------------|
| Structural Reviewer | Confirms branching parity; checks each ending appears in exported trace samples |
| Quality Balancer | Aggregates `choice_made.effects` for `STATS_MATRIX.md` tuning |
| Automation Planner | Designs Zapier step to upload exported trace JSON to analytics store |
| Conversion Engineer | Mirrors instrumentation pattern when porting new HTML scenes to ChoiceScript |
| Lore Curator | Ensures no lore-breaking endings by reviewing `path` sequences |

## ChoiceScript Version Instrumentation (Planned Pattern)
ChoiceScript doesn’t run in the same JS context, but you can approximate tracing:
1. Create a scene `trace_log.txt` containing a *gosub* routine:
   ```
   *label log_event
   *comment params: event_type, node, choice_text, collab, izack, aria, zara
   *comment trace_dump must be *created in startup.txt first
   *set trace_dump & (event_type & "|" & node & "|" & choice_text & "|" & collab & "|" & izack & "|" & aria & "|" & zara & "\n")
   *return
   ```
2. At each choice block in scenes add:
   ```
   *gosub_scene trace_log log_event "choice" "first_lesson" "Ask Zara to partner" collaborationScore izack aria zara
   ```
3. At endings add an `ending` event.
4. Expose a debug option to show aggregated `trace_dump` for copy/paste.

## Export & Automation Ideas
- Add a button to `index.html` for manual export:
  ```html
  <button onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(exportTrace())">Copy Trace JSON</button>
  ```
- Zapier/Webhook: POST `exportTrace()` payload on ending.
- Aggregation: Merge multiple trace JSON files to produce frequency histograms of choices.

## Next Extension Ideas
- Session UUID shown in UI (for playtest tagging)
- Time-in-node measurement (record display timestamp then diff on next choice)
- Error tracing (catch & log unexpected missing node references)
- Lightweight privacy filter (strip freeform player input if later added)

## Validation Checklist
- Opening play logs `init` then first `node_displayed` = `start`
- Every `choice_made` preceded by a `node_displayed` of its source node
- All endings produce exactly one `ending_reached` event
- `path` length in ending matches number of `choice_made` events

## Maintenance
Minimal footprint—update tracing only when new stat fields or relationship characters are added (append them to payload objects).

Enhance further? Ask to add export UI, aggregation scripts, or ChoiceScript stub scene scaffolding.

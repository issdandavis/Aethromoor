## 📍 File Location

**Current Location:** `/docs/avalon_materials/everweave-export.pdf`

**Previous Location (removed):** `/everweave-export.pdf` (root directory duplicate)

**Rationale for Placement:**
- Consistent with other campaign materials (all in `docs/avalon_materials/`)
- Keeps root directory clean and organized
- Groups with related source materials:
  - `Izack Campaign Chronicle.pdf`
  - `Izack_Complete_Campaign_Archive.pdf`
  - `Izack_DnD_Campaign_Consolidation_Guide.pdf`
  - Other campaign archives

## 🎯 Purpose & Usage

### Primary Use Cases:
1. **Character Development Reference** - Mining for Izack, Aria, Zara, and Polly dialogue and personality details
2. **World History Source** - Background for Avalon Academy founding and early magical discoveries
3. **Canonical Lore Verification** - Cross-referencing events in the Master Chronicle
4. **Novel Writing Inspiration** - Source material for narrative moments and character interactions

### Integration Status:
- ✅ **Cataloged** in materials index
- ✅ **Referenced** in documentation
- 🔄 **Curation in Progress** - Campaign moments being extracted to Master Chronicle
- ❌ **Not Directly Canonical** - Requires curation before integration

## ⚠️ Important Distinctions

### Campaign vs. Canon

**The Everweave export is SOURCE MATERIAL, not automatically canonical.**

**Campaign Material:**
- D&D gameplay narrative
- May contain game mechanics references
- Player choices and dice rolls affected outcomes
- Raw, uncurated content
- Experimental story elements

**Canonical Lore (Master Chronicle):**
- Curated from campaign materials
- Refined for narrative consistency
- Approved for official universe integration
- Found in: `docs/avalon_materials/IZACK_MASTER_CHRONICLE_UPDATED.txt`

### Integration Workflow:

## 📚 For Non-Technical Collaborators

### What You Need to Know:

**Location:** The Everweave PDF is in the `docs/avalon_materials/` folder.

**What It Contains:** A 406-page D&D campaign story featuring Izack Thorne's adventures.

**How to Use It:**
- **For Writing:** Great source of character dialogue and personality moments
- **For Worldbuilding:** Contains history and magic system details
- **For Verification:** Check if story moments are consistent with established lore

**Important:** This is source material, not the final story. Think of it like:
- **Everweave Export** = Raw footage from filming
- **Master Chronicle** = Final edited movie

Always check the Master Chronicle (`IZACK_MASTER_CHRONICLE_UPDATED.txt`) for what's officially "canon" in the universe.

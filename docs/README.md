## Quick Navigation

### I need to...
- **Organize GitHub issues** → Read `HOW_TO_CONSOLIDATE_ISSUES.md`
- **Create a new issue** → Use templates in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`
- **Understand the project** → Read `PROJECT_ROADMAP.md`
- **Contribute** → Read `../CONTRIBUTING.md`
- **Add lore** → Submit PR to `../lore/` directory
- **Work on the game** → See game development guides in `GAME_DEVELOPMENT_MASTER_REFERENCE.md`

Keep any new design documents or narrative sources under this folder to avoid mixing them with runnable game code.

# Documentation and Reference Materials

The `docs/` directory holds world-building material, transcripts, and other reference documents that inform the Avalon/Spiral of Eternity setting.

- `avalon_materials/` — bulk creative drafts, PDFs, and lore packages.
- `reference/` — smaller loose references that were previously in the repository root.

Keep any new design documents or narrative sources under this folder to avoid mixing them with runnable game code.

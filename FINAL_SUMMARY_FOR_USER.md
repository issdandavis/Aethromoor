## 🚀 HOW TO USE IT (30 SECONDS)

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
cd /path/to/Avalon
python .github/scripts/agent_manager_cli.py health
```

You'll see:
```
==================================================
  SYSTEM HEALTH: 60/100
  STATUS: ⚠️ WARNING
==================================================
```

Then see what needs fixing:
```bash
python .github/scripts/agent_manager_cli.py recommend
```

You'll see:
```
💡 RECOMMENDATIONS

1. 🔴 CRITICAL: Add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY to repository secrets
2. Initialize scene-writer by running its workflow
...
```

**Just follow the list!** That's it.

## 📊 Current System Health: 60/100

### Why 60/100?

Health score breakdown:
- ✅ All code is built (+40 points)
- ✅ No merge conflicts (+40 points)
- ⚠️ API key not configured (-10 points)
- ⚠️ Workers not initialized (-10 points each = -40)

**Score: 100 - 40 = 60/100** ✅ Expected before activation!

### What Happens After You Add API Key?

- Workers initialize (+40 points)
- Health jumps to 100/100
- Workers start running automatically
- PRs get created for review
- Your game develops itself!

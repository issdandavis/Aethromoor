- [ ] Stat balancing across all paths
- [ ] Achievement testing and verification
- [ ] Mobile optimization testing
- [ ] Submission to Hosted Games platform

### Pending Lore Updates
None currently - all major lore is established and integrated

## Key Files Currently Modified
None - ready for testing phase

## Active Branches
- `copilot/fix-bug-in-query-handler` - Creating multi-AI coordination files

## Known Issues
- Need to verify all 14 endings are properly reachable
- May need to balance Collaboration stat thresholds across expeditions
- Some romance scenes may need additional branching

## Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. Complete multi-AI coordination documentation
2. Begin comprehensive playtesting of all paths
3. Collect stat progression data across different playthroughs
4. Balance difficulty and threshold requirements
5. Prepare for beta testing phase

## AI Collaboration Notes
- All three main expeditions (Singing Dunes, Verdant Tithe, Rune Glacier) are complete
- ChoiceScript scenes maintain parity with HTML version narrative
- 14 unique endings provide meaningful variety based on player choices
- Collaboration stat is primary metric (ranges 0-100, starts at 50)
- Relationship stats with four main characters (Izack, Aria, Zara, Polly)

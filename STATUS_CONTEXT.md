## 🎯 Next Up (Priority Order)

### Immediate (This Week):
1. Complete enterprise setup guide

3. Set up GitHub Project board
4. Create SCENE_PARITY_CHECKLIST.md
5. Create STATS_MATRIX.md

### Near Term (Next 1-2 Weeks):

## 🐛 Known Issues

### Technical:
- ChoiceScript validation workflow is placeholder only
- No automated testing for scene syntax
- Manual coordination between HTML and ChoiceScript versions

### Content:
- Expedition scenes need expansion from placeholders
- Endings need individual implementation
- Stat thresholds need balancing once all scenes complete

### Process:
- Single developer workflow needs formalization
- AI coordination system not yet tested in practice
- Beta testing process not yet designed

---

## 💡 Ideas & Notes

### Process Improvements:
- Consider using GitHub Projects for kanban board
- Set up automated weekly status reports
- Create templates for scene expansion
- Document AI prompts that work well

### Content Ideas:
- Add achievement unlock notifications in ChoiceScript
- Consider adding character-specific endings
- Potential for hidden paths in each expedition
- Easter eggs referencing broader Spiral universe

### Future Phases:
- Phase 3: Polish & balance (1-2 weeks)
- Phase 4: Beta testing (3-4 weeks)
- Phase 5: Publication submission
- Phase 6: Expansion content (sequels/DLC)

## 📞 Handoff Context for Next Session

### If Continuing Enterprise Setup:
- Main file created: `ENTERPRISE_SETUP_GUIDE.md`
- Still need to create: SCENE_PARITY_CHECKLIST.md, STATS_MATRIX.md
- Account #2 needs to be added as collaborator
- GitHub Project board needs creation

### If Starting Scene Expansion:
- Reference: `.github/COPILOT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for ChoiceScript syntax
- Source content: `game/game.js` (search for node names)
- Template: `choicescript_game/scenes/first_lesson.txt`
- Target: singing_dunes.txt needs 15-20 scenes

### If Working on Lore:
- Check: `lore/` directory for existing canon
- Validate against: Character chronicles and magic systems
- Update: This file with any new lore additions

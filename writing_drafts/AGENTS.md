# Writing Drafts - AI Agent Instructions

## 📚 Purpose
This directory contains **novel manuscripts, narrative experiments, and draft content** for the Spiral of Pollyoneth universe - including the full four-generation epic that expands beyond the game content.

## 📁 Directory Structure

```

├── spiral-of-pollyoneth-novel.md  → Main novel manuscript

└── [Additional draft files]        → Experimental or alternate narratives
```

## 🎯 Relationship to Game Content

**Writing Drafts vs. Game Content:**
- **Writing Drafts**: Full novel form, deeper character exploration, extended scenes
- **Game Content**: Interactive, choice-based, condensed for gameplay
- **Lore Directory**: Canonical facts, timeline, magic rules (source of truth)

**Consistency Requirements:**
- ✅ Novel must align with lore canon (check `../lore/`)
- ✅ Character personalities must match established traits
- ✅ Timeline events must be consistent across all media
- ✅ Magic system logic must follow dimensional theory
- ⚠️ Novel can include scenes/details not in game (that's expected)
- ⚠️ Novel can have different narrative structure than game

## 📖 Novel Writing Standards

### Narrative Voice
**The Spiral of Pollyoneth series uses:**
- Third-person limited perspective
- Character-focused POV (deep into character thoughts)
- Accessible YA fantasy tone with adult depth
- Lyrical but clear prose
- Balance of dialogue, action, and introspection

**Example of appropriate voice:**
```
✅ CORRECT:
Izack pressed his palm against the shimmering boundary between 
dimensions. The magic sang to him, not with dominance, but with 
invitation—a dance offered, not a servant commanded. Polly's 
presence flickered at the edge of his awareness, amused and patient.

"You're overthinking again," she murmured, her voice carrying that 
particular tone of ancient wisdom wrapped in gentle mockery.

❌ INCORRECT:
Izack touched the magic. It was cool. Polly talked to him.
"Don't think too much," she said.
(Too sparse, no personality, no depth)

❌ ALSO INCORRECT:
The magnificent, glorious, stupendous Izack Thorne, master of the 
arcane arts and lord of dimensional magic, wielded his incredible 
power with the force of a thousand suns...
(Too purple, contradicts Izack's humility, over-the-top)
```

### Character Development Arcs

**Izack's Journey (Generation 1):**
- Discovers collaborative magic
- Challenges magical establishment
- Founds Avalon Academy
- Becomes unexpected king
- Grapples with power and responsibility
- Legacy: Transforms magical philosophy

**Polly's Arc (Across All Generations):**
- Ancient entity learning to connect with mortals
- Protective of Izack and his descendants
- Guides each generation with evolving wisdom
- Balances humor with genuine care
- Thread connecting all four generations

**Alexander's Journey (Generation 2):**
- Inherits father's philosophy but faces different challenges
- Political intrigue, demon threats
- Navigating legacy vs. forging own path
- Relationship with Polly as successor

**Future Generations:**
- Each generation faces escalating dimensional threats
- Collaborative magic philosophy tested and evolved
- Family legacy vs. individual identity
- Culminates in multi-character perspective for final generation

## ✏️ Writing Guidelines

### When Adding Novel Content

**DO:**
- ✅ Expand on game scenes with deeper character thoughts
- ✅ Add scenes between game events for continuity
- ✅ Develop secondary characters mentioned in lore
- ✅ Explore magic system mechanics in detail
- ✅ Build world through sensory details
- ✅ Show character growth through multiple scenes
- ✅ Include cultural/political depth not in game

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Contradict lore canon (check `../lore/` first)
- ❌ Change character personalities from established traits
- ❌ Alter timeline events without updating lore
- ❌ Add magic system rules that break dimensional theory
- ❌ Make Polly purely serious (she's sarcastic, always)
- ❌ Have Izack use hierarchical magic approvingly
- ❌ Break established character relationships

### Lore Consistency Validation

**Before writing new scenes, check:**
1. **Timeline**: Where does this fit in the 150+ year saga?
2. **Character Ages**: Who is alive? What age are they?
3. **Relationships**: What's the status of character dynamics at this point?
4. **Magic Rules**: Does this scene's magic follow established logic?
5. **World State**: What's happening politically/dimensionally at this time?

**Reference documents:**
- `../lore/IZACK_MASTER_CHRONICLE_UPDATED.txt` - Character timeline
- `../lore/Lore_Codex.txt` - Magic system rules
- `../lore/Unified Worldbuilding Master Framework.txt` - Universe structure
- `../game/index.html` - Game version of shared scenes

### Dialogue Writing Standards

**Each character should have distinct speech patterns:**

**Izack:**
```
✅ "Let's approach this together. The magic will respond to partnership."
✅ "I've made my share of mistakes. What matters is learning from them."
❌ "Obey my command!" (Contradicts collaborative philosophy)
```

**Polly:**
```
✅ "Oh, how delightfully dramatic. Do go on."
✅ "I've seen empires rise and fall, little mage. This? This is Tuesday."
❌ "That is the correct strategic approach." (Too formal, no personality)
```

**Aria:**
```
✅ "Precision isn't perfectionism. It's respect for the boundary itself."
✅ "Try again. This time, feel where the dimensions meet."
❌ "Whatever, close enough works." (Contradicts her exacting nature)
```

**Zara:**
```
✅ "Ooh! What if we tried freezing it from the inside out?"
✅ "Ice isn't cold and dead—it's alive with possibility!"
❌ "Follow protocol exactly." (Contradicts her experimental nature)
```

## 🎨 Scene Structure for Novel

**Effective scene template:**

1. **Opening Hook**: Sensory detail or character emotion
2. **Setting Grounding**: Where are we? What's the atmosphere?
3. **Character Introduction**: Who's present? What are they doing/feeling?
4. **Conflict/Goal**: What needs to happen in this scene?
5. **Rising Action**: Complications, dialogue, magical challenges
6. **Climax**: Peak of scene tension
7. **Resolution**: How does the scene end?
8. **Transition**: Bridge to next scene or chapter

**Example structure:**
```
Hook: "The boundary shimmered like oil on water, and Izack's 
       stomach twisted with anticipation."

Setting: "The practice chamber in Avalon's East Tower smelled of 
          chalk dust and ozone..."

Character: "Aria stood beside him, her precision-focused gaze 
            already analyzing the dimensional interface..."

[Continue with conflict, action, resolution, transition]
```

## 🔄 Integration with Game Content

### When Novel Scenes Inform Game Dialogue

**If you write a novel scene that improves character understanding:**
- Consider if dialogue could enhance game scenes
- Suggest updates to game team (don't directly edit game files)
- Document in commit message: "Novel scene may inform [game scene name]"

**If you discover lore inconsistency while writing:**
1. Stop writing
2. Check `../lore/` documents thoroughly
3. If genuine inconsistency: discuss with Lore Curator role
4. If novel is wrong: revise novel to match lore
5. If lore needs clarification: propose lore document update

### Cross-Referencing Game and Novel

**Shared scenes between game and novel:**
- Game version: Condensed, interactive, player-focused
- Novel version: Expanded, detailed, character-introspective
- Both must have same outcome and character beats

**Example - First Lesson:**
- **Game**: 3,500 words, player makes collaboration choices, Polly comments
- **Novel**: 8,000+ words, Izack's internal thoughts, deeper magic theory, fuller Aria characterization, same core events

## 📝 Manuscript Organization

### Chapter Structure
- **Chapter Headings**: Clear, evocative (e.g., "Chapter 3: The Singing Dunes")
- **Chapter Length**: 3,000-6,000 words typical
- **POV**: Consistent within chapter (don't switch mid-chapter unless intentional)
- **Chapter Arc**: Each chapter should have mini arc (goal, conflict, resolution)

### Generation Structure
- **Book 1**: Izack's journey (founding of Avalon Academy)
- **Book 2**: Alexander's journey (political intrigue, demon threats)
- **Book 3**: Third generation (escalating conflicts)
- **Book 4**: Fourth generation (culmination, multi-POV, epic conclusion)

### Pacing Guidelines
- **Action**: Magic battles, dimensional travel, urgent decisions
- **Reflection**: Character growth, relationship development, philosophical discussions
- **Balance**: Alternate action and reflection for rhythm
- **Polly Breaks**: Use Polly's commentary to lighten heavy moments

## To Play the Game Right Now (bundled ChoiceScript engine)

### **1. Find this folder on your computer:**
```
Avalon/
```

### **2. Open the packaged ChoiceScript build:**
```
Avalon/choicescript_game/web/index.html
```

### **3. If your browser blocks local files:**
Run a quick local server, then refresh:
```
cd Avalon/choicescript_game/web
python3 -m http.server 8000
```
Then open http://localhost:8000/ in your browser.

### **4. Smoke-check (30 seconds):**
- Load `choicescript_game/web/index.html`
- Confirm the ChoiceScript UI renders (title, menu buttons, and opening text)
- If anything fails to load, see `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` for fixes and CSIDE/IDE alternatives.

### **5. Play!**
Click the choice buttons to play.

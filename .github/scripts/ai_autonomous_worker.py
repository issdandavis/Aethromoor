- Task queue with priorities
- Lore documents and character information
- Style guidelines and rules

Core principles:
1. Make small, incremental changes
2. Preserve character voices (Polly is sarcastic, Izack is nervous, etc.)
3. Every scene needs at least one taste or smell
4. Follow ChoiceScript syntax perfectly
5. Test your changes before completing

You should provide your changes as a detailed plan of file edits.

## Task Attempted
**Priority:** {task['priority']}
**Description:** {task['description']}

## Status
This was a DEMONSTRATION run. No actual changes were made.

## What Would Happen in Production
1. AI would read task requirements from AI_TASK_QUEUE.md
2. AI would review related files and lore documents
3. AI would generate content matching Spiralverse style
4. AI would edit files with new content
5. AI would verify ChoiceScript syntax
6. AI would commit changes with meaningful message
7. AI would update task queue to mark task complete

## Next Steps
To enable full autonomous operation:
1. Add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY to repository secrets
2. Review and approve the AI worker implementation
3. Enable the GitHub Actions workflow
4. Monitor first few runs closely
5. Gradually increase autonomy as confidence grows

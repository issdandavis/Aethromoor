# The Avalon Codex - AI Coding Agent Instructions

## Project Overview
This is "The Avalon Codex" - a multi-generational fantasy narrative project centered around **Polly's Wingscroll: The First Thread**, a choice-based interactive game set in the Spiral of Pollyoneth universe.

## Essential Architecture

### Dual Game Structure
- **HTML Version** (`game/index.html`) - Complete, playable browser game with 30+ scenes and 14 endings
- **ChoiceScript Version** (`choicescript_game/`) - Professional mobile game framework for app store publication
- Both versions tell the same story with different technical implementations

### Content Organization
- **`lore/`** - Fantasy worldbuilding (characters, magic systems, geography)
- **`writing_drafts/`** - Novel manuscripts and narrative content
- **`game/`** - Complete HTML game (40,000+ words)
- **`choicescript_game/`** - Professional game framework (partial implementation)
- **`docs/`** - Project roadmaps and automation guides

## Critical Patterns

### The Spiral of Pollyoneth Universe
- **Central Character**: Izack Thorne (mage-turned-king who founded Avalon Academy)
- **Key Companion**: Polly ("Polydimensional Manifestation of Accumulated Wisdom and Occasional Sarcasm")
- **Core Magic System**: Collaborative casting vs. hierarchical magical control
- **Narrative Structure**: Four-generation epic spanning 150+ years

### Game Development Workflow
1. **HTML First**: Content prototyped in browser-based version (`game/`)
2. **ChoiceScript Conversion**: Professional scenes built in `choicescript_game/scenes/`
3. **Cross-Reference Required**: HTML and ChoiceScript versions must maintain story parity

### File Naming Conventions
- **Chapter Files**: Use descriptive titles (`# Chapter 1 The Cave and the Contra.txt`)
- **Character Chronicles**: Named by protagonist (`IZACK_MASTER_CHRONICLE_UPDATED.txt`)
- **Game Scenes**: Descriptive lowercase (`first_lesson.txt`, `singing_dunes.txt`)

## Development Guidelines

### When Working on Game Content
- Always check both HTML (`game/`) and ChoiceScript (`choicescript_game/`) versions
- Maintain consistency between character names, stats, and story beats
- Reference `docs/PROJECT_ROADMAP.md` for current development phase
- Test narrative choices lead to appropriate stat changes (Collaboration, relationships)

### When Working on Lore
- Cross-reference character details in `IZACK_MASTER_CHRONICLE_UPDATED.txt`
- Maintain consistency with established magic system (dimensional theory, collaborative casting)
- Check character relationships span multiple generations correctly

### Repository Navigation
- **Start Here**: `START_HERE.md` for quickest orientation
- **Play Game**: `game/index.html` (double-click to play)
- **File Locations**: `FILE_LOCATIONS.txt` for quick reference
- **Development Status**: `docs/PROJECT_ROADMAP.md`

## Integration Points

### External Dependencies
- **ChoiceScript IDE** for professional game development
- **Zapier Workflows** (documented in `docs/AUTOMATION_GUIDE.md`)
- **GitHub Pages** for HTML game deployment
- **Hosted Games Platform** for mobile publication

### Key Relationships
- HTML game scenes → ChoiceScript scene conversion
- Character lore → Game dialogue consistency
- Statistical progression → Narrative outcome branching
- Multi-generational timeline → Character relationship continuity

## Quality Standards
- **Word Count**: 40,000+ words across all game content
- **Narrative Paths**: 14 unique endings with meaningful choice consequences
- **Character Consistency**: Cross-reference character details across all documents
- **Technical Parity**: HTML and ChoiceScript versions tell identical stories

## Current Priority
Phase 2 development: Converting remaining HTML expeditions (`singing_dunes.txt`, `verdant_tithe.txt`, `rune_glacier.txt`) to ChoiceScript format while maintaining narrative consistency and implementing proper stat tracking.

# Lore and Writing Content Instructions

## Overview

This file provides guidance for working with worldbuilding documents (`lore/`) and novel manuscripts (`writing_drafts/`). These contain the narrative universe of the Avalon/Spiralverse setting.

## Worldbuilding Principles

### The Avalon Universe

Key concepts to maintain:
- **Collaborative magic**: Magic is stronger and safer when mages work together
- **Living dimensions**: Pocket dimensions and realms are sentient or semi-sentient
- **Boundary magic**: Izack Thorne's specialty, working with dimensional boundaries
- **The World Tree**: Central to the magic system, connects realms
- **Avalon Academy**: A living pocket dimension that teaches collaborative magic

### Canonical Sources

Primary worldbuilding documents in `lore/`:
- Geography and realm descriptions
- Character backstories and abilities
- Magic system explanations
- Historical timeline
- Polly's Wingscrolls (narrative-style worldbuilding)

**Always check existing lore before adding new content**

### Consistency Requirements

✅ **Must maintain:**
- Character personalities and abilities
- Established geography and realm properties
- Magic system rules and limitations
- Timeline and historical events
- Power levels and magical hierarchies
- Tone (dark setting, optimistic outcomes)

❌ **Avoid:**
- Contradicting established lore
- Making characters more/less powerful arbitrarily
- Changing fundamental magic system rules
- Altering timeline without clear reason
- Adding content that breaks existing story arcs

## Character Voices

### Polly (Polymnia Aetheris)
- **Age**: Ancient (300+ years)
- **Voice**: Sarcastic, witty, meta-aware, secretly caring
- **Role**: Narrator, familiar, guide
- **Quirks**: Breaks fourth wall, makes bird jokes, pretends to be grumpy but is protective
- **Speech patterns**: "*Caw!*", "You're welcome for that information", sardonic observations

Example:
> "*Caw!* Oh wonderful, another dimensional crisis. Because my Tuesday wasn't exciting enough already. Fine, let's go save reality again. But this time, I'm keeping a tally of near-death experiences."

### Izack Thorne
- **Role**: Boundary mage, Academy founder, protagonist of novels
- **Voice**: Patient, wise, humble despite power
- **Philosophy**: Listen to magic, collaborate, respect boundaries
- **Speech patterns**: Thoughtful, uses teaching moments, references dimensional theory naturally

Example:
> "The boundary isn't a wall—it's a conversation. If you listen, really listen, you can hear what the realm is trying to tell you."

### Aria Windcaller
- **Role**: Air mage, theorist, professor
- **Voice**: Precise, intellectual, enthusiastic about theory
- **Philosophy**: Understanding before action
- **Speech patterns**: Uses technical terms, references research, methodical

### Zara Thornheart
- **Role**: Living magic specialist, nature mage
- **Voice**: Warm, intuitive, connected to magic emotionally
- **Philosophy**: Feel the magic, trust your instincts
- **Speech patterns**: Poetic, uses nature metaphors, gentle encouragement

## Writing Style

### Narrative Tone
- **Dark setting**: Genuine threats, real consequences, dangerous magic
- **Optimistic outcomes**: Hope prevails, collaboration succeeds, growth is possible
- **Balance**: Don't shy from darkness, but always provide paths forward

### Descriptive Elements
- **Magic descriptions**: Use sensory details (how magic feels, sounds, looks)
- **Dimensional travel**: Emphasize the uncanny and otherworldly
- **Character emotions**: Show through action and dialogue, not just telling

### Dialogue
- Give each character a distinct voice
- Use dialogue tags that enhance character (said, muttered, chirped for Polly)
- Balance exposition with natural conversation
- Let humor arise from character, not forced jokes

## Novel Content (writing_drafts/)

### The Spiral of Avalon/Pollyoneth
These are novel manuscripts set in the same universe as the game.

#### Structure
- Book 1 (The Spiral of Pollyoneth) features Izack's early adventures
- Polly is the narrator with her characteristic voice
- Themes of collaboration, sacrifice, and dimensional magic

#### Editing Guidelines
- Maintain narrative continuity within the book
- Keep Polly's narrator voice consistent throughout
- Preserve the chapter structure and pacing
- Ensure worldbuilding aligns with `lore/` documents

#### Adding New Content
- Check timeline compatibility with game events
- Maintain character development arcs
- Reference established locations and magic systems
- Keep tone consistent with existing chapters

## Lore Documents (lore/)

### Types of Lore Documents

1. **Geographic/Realm Descriptions**
   - Physical properties of realms
   - Magical characteristics
   - Inhabitants and ecology
   - Connections to other realms

2. **Character Lore**
   - Backstories and motivations
   - Abilities and limitations
   - Relationships with other characters
   - Character development over time

3. **Magic System Documentation**

   - Limitations and costs
   - Training and mastery
   - Interactions between magic types

4. **Historical Timeline**
   - Key events in chronological order
   - Cause and effect relationships
   - Impact on current story state

### Adding New Lore

When adding new worldbuilding:
1. Check for conflicts with existing lore
2. Consider implications for game narrative
3. Maintain internal consistency
4. Use clear, organized formatting
5. Cross-reference related documents

### Lore Integration

New lore should:
- Enhance existing story without contradicting it
- Feel like a natural extension of the universe
- Be usable in future game content or story arcs
- Respect established power levels and rules

## Common Tasks

### Updating Character Lore
- Maintain character voice and personality
- Keep power levels consistent
- Track character relationships and development
- Note any abilities or limitations

### Expanding Geographic Lore
- Describe realm properties clearly
- Note connections to other realms
- Include inhabitants and ecology
- Mention magical properties and risks

### Adding Historical Events
- Place in timeline accurately
- Show cause and effect
- Consider impact on present-day story
- Maintain consistency with character ages and relationships

### Writing New Novel Content
- Match existing chapter structure
- Maintain Polly's narrator voice
- Check continuity with existing chapters
- Align with lore documents

## Quality Standards

### For Lore Documents
✅ **Good lore:**
- Consistent with existing universe
- Adds depth without contradicting
- Organized and clearly written
- Cross-referenced with related docs
- Usable for future content

❌ **Avoid:**
- Contradictions with established lore
- Overly detailed minutiae
- Content that limits future storytelling
- Unexplained major power additions
- Lore that breaks game narrative

### For Novel Content
✅ **Good writing:**
- Maintains character voices
- Advances plot meaningfully
- Rich sensory descriptions
- Natural dialogue
- Balanced pacing

❌ **Avoid:**
- Out-of-character dialogue
- Info dumps without narrative purpose
- Contradicting earlier chapters
- Breaking established worldbuilding
- Inconsistent tone

## Research and References

Before adding or modifying content:
1. Read relevant existing lore documents
2. Review related game content
3. Check character profiles for consistency
4. Verify timeline placement
5. Consider impact on other story elements

## Archive Policy

The `archive/` directory contains historical files. These should:
- Not be modified (historical record)
- Not be considered canonical (may be outdated)
- Be referenced only for historical context
- Never override current lore documents

## Collaboration Between Lore and Game

Game content and lore should reinforce each other:
- Game events should align with worldbuilding
- Lore should enhance player understanding
- Character portrayals should be consistent
- Magic system should work the same in both contexts

When in doubt, prioritize:
1. Current game content (most visible to players)
2. `lore/` directory (canonical reference)
3. Recent novel chapters (active narrative)
4. Archive material (historical context only)

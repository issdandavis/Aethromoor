# Multi-AI Coordination System Documentation

This document outlines the multi-AI coordination system utilized in the Avalon project, detailing the handoff stages between @Copilot and @Claude.

## Overview
The Avalon project employs a multi-AI coordination system to enhance efficiency and leverage the strengths of different AI models. This system facilitates seamless transitions between AI assistants to achieve better outcomes in various tasks.

## Handoff Stages

### 1. Task Assignment
- **Description**: Initial task assignment takes place where the main task is defined.
- **Responsible AI**: @Copilot is responsible for the task setup and initial input generation.

### 2. Processing
- **Description**: The task is actively processed. @Copilot creates the initial drafts or solutions based on the defined requirements.
- **Output**: An output is generated, which is then evaluated for quality and completeness.

### 3. Handoff to @Claude
- **Description**: Upon completion of the initial processing, @Copilot hands off the task to @Claude for further refinement.
- **Criteria for Handoff**: The output from @Copilot must meet predetermined quality thresholds.

### 4. Refinement by @Claude
- **Description**: @Claude reviews and enhances the output, addressing any limitations and improving coherence and usability.
- **Output**: The refined output is finalized and prepared for delivery or implementation.

### 5. Feedback Loop
- **Description**: Post-delivery feedback is collected to assess performance.
- **Purpose**: This feedback is crucial for refining task definitions and improving future handoffs.

## Conclusion
Understanding the multi-AI coordination system is essential for ensuring the efficient collaboration between AI models. By following the outlined stages, we can leverage the unique capabilities of each AI and maximize our productivity.

You return to the suspended council platforms. The elders stand beneath auroras of data—visualizations of the Everweave's tremors.

*label debt_refrain
*if echo_debt >= 20
  The Spiral's echo clings to you like frost. Elders trace the debt with wary eyes.
*elseif echo_debt >= 10
  A faint shimmer follows your steps, proof of the risks you accepted.
*else
  Your movements are clean, your debts light.
*return

"Reports of the stutter reached every banner," one elder says. "What did you bring back?"

The council deliberates while the Spiral sings.

*if (alliances >= 70) and (everweave_insight >= 60) and (echo_debt <= 15)
  The elders nod. "You wove Avalon tighter and warned our friends." They grant you stewardship of a new skybridge.
  *set honor +5
  *ending
*elseif (honor >= 70) and oathbound
  The wardens take you aside. "Your duty is to protect, even from council politics." They grant you command of the martial hall.
  *ending
*elseif (attunement >= 65) and resonance_mark
  The Spiral itself pulses in your favor. The elders step back as you attune the chamber and rewrite the lattice.
  *set everweave_insight +5
  *ending
*elseif echo_debt >= 25
  Your debts roar louder than your triumphs. The elders exile you beyond the bridges until the Spiral quiets.
  *ending
*else
  The council delays a final judgment, assigning you to mend minor portals until your song steadies.

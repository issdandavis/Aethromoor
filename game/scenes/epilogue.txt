*comment ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

You pause at the threshold of a balcony overlooking the Spiral. Choices made today ripple outward like stones dropped in cosmic waters. Couriers and wardens move below, carrying the effects of your decisions into the wider city.

The view is breathtaking: Avalon spreads before you in all its impossible glory. The Spiral Spire reflects starlight even at noon. Floating islands drift on leyline currents. The Dream Gardens bloom in response to students' emotional states. The World Tree's branches reach toward other dimensions while its roots anchor Pollyoneth to principles worth protecting.

Everything you've learned, everyone you've met, every choice you've made—they've all led to this moment of reflection.

*comment @issdandavis - Personalized reflection based on player's path

*if resonance_mark
  The Chronological Nexus Staff (if you carry it) hums contentedly in your grip. You can feel time itself acknowledging your growth—not just chronological passage, but {i}developmental{/i} time. You've become someone different from who you were when you awakened in that cave.
  
  The Spiral thrums in time with your pulse, marking you as one who listens to what magic itself is trying to communicate.

*if oathbound
  Your oath-marks gleam with steady light. The commitments you've sworn aren't burdens—they're clarifications, crystallizing who you choose to be into magical form.
  
  The badge of the wardens catches sunlight, reminding you that service and strength can balance, that protection requires understanding what's worth defending.

*if not(resonance_mark) and not(oathbound)
  You haven't sworn grand oaths or bonded with legendary artifacts, but you've learned something equally valuable: that growth happens through choices accumulated, that wisdom emerges from questions asked, that becoming worthy is a process, not a destination.
  
  The council watches with measured interest, seeing potential not yet fully realized but definitely present.

*comment @issdandavis - Council and mentor assessments

*if council_trust >= 80
  An elder approaches—Elder Veyara herself, which is significant. "You've earned considerable trust in remarkably short time, ${player_name}. The council would like to formalize your role within Avalon's structure."
  
  She presents a crystal token, glowing with the council's collective magical signature. "This grants you status as Council Observer and emerging voice in governance. Your perspective will be sought on matters requiring fresh insight."
  
  *set guild_affiliation "Council Observer"
  
  *if mentor = "Aria"
    Aria beams with pride. "Exactly the kind of rapid integration Izack and I hoped Avalon would facilitate. You've proven yourself through action, not just words."

*elseif council_trust >= 65
  Several council members nod respectfully as you stand on the balcony. You've demonstrated capability and wisdom. Trust is budding, growing stronger with each choice that honors Avalon's principles.
  
  *if mentor = "Polly"
    "Solid foundation," Polly assesses. "Not revolutionary yet, but definitely promising. Keep asking productive questions."

*else
  Whispers ripple along the balcony. You're known now—newer members of Avalon's community notice you, curious about your path and potential. Trust will come with continued demonstration of Avalon's principles.
  
  *if mentor = "Corin"
    "Every warden starts here," Corin reassures. "Known but not yet proven. That's normal, expected. You'll earn deeper trust through consistent service."

*comment @issdandavis - The World Tree's final communication

As you stand in reflection, the World Tree—that vast consciousness connecting dimensions—reaches out one more time.

*if (attunement >= 75)
  You perceive its message clearly: {i}Thank you for asking what I need rather than demanding what you want. You understand that magic is conversation. That understanding will shape you into something remarkable.{/i}
  
  *set dimensional_understanding +2

*if (honor >= 75)
  You feel its approval: {i}You understand that strength serves purpose, that protection requires knowing what's worth defending. Your oaths honor what I was planted to embody.{/i}

*if (council_trust >= 75)
  A whisper of gratitude: {i}Collaborative magic planted me. Nine traditions working together, creating something none could achieve alone. You've embraced that principle. Help me grow it further.{/i}

*if (attunement >= 70) and (honor >= 70) and (council_trust >= 70)
  The World Tree's full attention focuses on you—rare, powerful, transformative. {i}You embody balance we need. Scholar-warrior. Protector-facilitator. Someone who understands that boundaries exist for conversation, not conquest. The Third Thread generation needs peers like you. The Spiral itself celebrates your growth.{/i}
  
  Your entire being resonates with the Tree's acknowledgment. This is blessing and responsibility combined.

*comment @issdandavis - Meeting Izack and Aria (if player excelled)

*if (council_trust >= 75) and ((attunement >= 70) or (honor >= 70))
  A shimmer of dimensional energy announces new arrivals. Two figures materialize on the balcony—and you immediately recognize them from Archive descriptions and Polly's stories.
  
  **Izack Thorne** (Isimar Caedyn Sova) wears his ancient robes that have learned to teach, carrying his staff with casual familiarity. His eyes hold both theoretical curiosity and hard-won wisdom.
  
  **Aria Ravencrest** moves with warrior-scholar grace, her silver hair incorporating runic threads, her presence making leylines sing. The awakened bloodline magic still resonates within her.
  
  "Well met, ${player_name}," Izack says, his voice warm with genuine interest. "Polly's been sending updates about your progress. Someone who treats dimensional boundaries as collaborative opportunities rather than walls to breach—that's rare and valuable."
  
  Aria adds, "And someone who understands that strength serves purpose, that scholarship requires both openness and discipline. You remind us of ourselves when we first started building this place."
  
  *if mentor = "Polly"
    Polly practically preens on your shoulder. "Told you they were promising. Revolutionary thinking wrapped in productive questioning."
  
  Izack extends his hand. "Avalon grows through people like you—those willing to question assumptions while honoring principles, to push boundaries while understanding what makes them necessary. Welcome to the ongoing experiment of collaborative magic."
  
  *set council_trust +15
  *set dimensional_understanding +1
  
  *if resonance_mark
    Izack notices the Chronological Nexus Staff's resonance with you. "The staff chose well. Time magic requires understanding that causality is conversation, not conquest. You have that instinct."

*comment @issdandavis - Final choice: How to continue the journey

The sun begins its descent toward horizons that shift based on which dimension you're viewing from. Evening in Pollyoneth carries its own magic—softer, more contemplative, inviting reflection on what was learned and anticipation of what comes next.

*choice
  #Reflect on your journey—review what you've learned and become.
    You stand quietly, letting the day's experiences settle into understanding. Every choice made, every path walked, every conversation engaged—they've all contributed to who you're becoming.
    
    *if mentor = "Aria"
      Aria speaks softly: "Izack taught me that growth isn't linear—it's spiral. You return to similar questions at different levels of understanding. Each circuit deepens wisdom."
    
    *if mentor = "Polly"
      "Learning through reflection," Polly approves. "Most people rush forward without integrating what they've experienced. You're showing wisdom."
    
    *if mentor = "Corin"
      "Warriors meditate after battle," Corin says. "Not to forget the experience, but to learn from it. You're demonstrating that discipline."
    
    The Spiral seems to acknowledge your contemplation, its harmonics softening to support introspection.
    
    *goto final_stats
  
  #Look toward the future—what comes next in your Avalon journey?
    Tomorrow brings new challenges: deeper Archive study, advanced warden training, council sessions addressing complex diplomatic questions. The Third Thread generation awaits, offering partnership in discovering magic's next evolution.
    
    *if (attunement >= 70) and (honor >= 70)
      You realize you're not just student anymore—you're becoming teacher, leader, architect of Avalon's ongoing development. The synthesis you've achieved positions you to help others find their own balance.
    
    *if council_trust >= 75
      Elder Veyara's invitation to serve as Council Observer opens paths you hadn't imagined when you first awakened in that cave. Governance, diplomacy, shaping policy that affects multiple realms.
    
    *if oathbound
      Your oaths will guide you forward, clarifying which opportunities serve Avalon's principles and which distract from what truly matters.
    
    The future spirals outward in possibility. You're ready to meet it.
    
    *goto final_stats
  
  #Step forward into the Spiral once more—your journey continues.
    This ending is really a beginning. Everything you've learned prepares you for challenges ahead. Questions you've asked open new avenues of exploration. Relationships you've built create networks of collaborative possibility.
    
    *if resonance_mark
      The Chronological Nexus Staff hums with anticipation. Time magic recognizes that this moment—right now—is pivot point where past learning becomes future capability.
    
    *if mentor = "Polly"
      "That's the spirit," Polly says. "The Spiral doesn't end—it {i}spirals{/i}. Each circuit brings you back to familiar questions at deeper understanding. Keep walking that path."
    
    *if mentor = "Aria"
      "Izack and I planted a World Seed not knowing what it would become," Aria reflects. "You're planting your own seeds through choices you make, paths you walk. Trust the process."
    
    The path shifts with every decision. New branches spiral outward from here, each representing different possibilities, different futures you might help create.

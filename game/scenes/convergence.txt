You emerge onto a circular landing where the three portals meet. A lattice of light hums beneath your feet, recording traces of what you've done.

*comment Offer bespoke acknowledgments based on prior flags and stats.
*if (oathbound and resonance_mark)
  The Spiral recognizes both your oath and your resonance. Elders and wardens glance your way, curious which you will lean on.
*elseif oathbound
  Your oath to the wardens anchors the lattice, bright as a drawn blade.
*elseif resonance_mark
  The Spiral's song follows you, weaving a counter-melody through the hall.
*else
  For now, your choices leave only faint trails. Avalon waits to see how you'll impress it.

A courier approaches with three sealed missives, each bearing a different crest.

*choice
  #Answer the research call from the Aerie Conservatory.
    The missive requests someone attuned to the Spiral to help tune a wavering beacon.
    *if attunement >= 65
      Your earlier harmonics steady the beacon immediately. Archivists scribble notes as the signal clarifies.

      *set council_trust +5
      *goto after_convergence
    *else
      The beacon sputters before stabilizing. You promise to return with sharper focus.

    *if (honor >= 60) and (attunement >= 60)
      Together you draft a joint initiative, convincing the council to fund it.
      *set council_trust +10

            <p>You stand at the edge of Avalon Academy, watching the impossible spiral spire twist upward into clouds that shimmer with leyline energy. The World Tree's branches arc overhead, and you can <em>feel</em> the convergence of magical currents thrumming through the air.</p>

No, the irony is not lost on me. I'll be your narrator, occasional advisor, and the only honest voice you'll hear today."</span></p>

Fair warning: he's brilliant, kind, and will absolutely try to convince you that listening to magical currents is more important than controlling them. He's not wrong, but don't tell him I said that."</span></p>

            <p><strong>Ending: The Runeweaver</strong></p>

            <p>Your time at the Rune Glacier has transformed you into a master of written magic. You can read spells in ice, stone, and air. You understand that runes aren't just symbols - they're living conversations frozen into form.</p>

            <p>Aria takes you as a personal apprentice. "You've learned what took me decades - that the most powerful magic comes from working with existing patterns rather than imposing your own."</p>

            <p><span class="polly-comment">"You literally made friends with a sentient glacier. That's either brilliance or madness, and I'm honestly not sure which. Possibly both."</span></p>

            <p>Over time, you develop a unique specialty: you can write runes that adapt to their environment, spells that rewrite themselves to respond to changing conditions. Your defensive wards don't just protect - they learn and evolve.</p>

            <p>When a crisis threatens Avalon's boundaries, you're the one who inscribes the new protections - runes that sing in harmony with the realm's heartbeat, barriers that flex instead of break, defenses that collaborate rather than simply resist.</p>

            <p>The Rune Glacier sends you gifts sometimes: ice that won't melt, carrying new patterns for you to study. You've become its student for life.</p>

            <p><em>You are the Runeweaver - a mage who writes magic as living conversation, proving that the most enduring spells are those that work in harmony with the world.</em></p>

            <p>You respectfully decline the Heartwood's fruit, bowing deeply to the ancient tree. "I'm honored beyond words, but I'm not ready for such a bond. I still have so much to learn."</p>

            <p>The Heartwood's awareness shifts - and you sense... approval? The tree's roots form a different pattern, and a single leaf falls into your hand - silver-edged, glowing faintly.</p>

            <p><span class="polly-comment">"The tree respects your honesty. By admitting you're not ready, you proved the wisdom it was looking for. That leaf is a promise - when you ARE ready, the Heartwood will remember you."</span></p>

            <p>Izack places a hand on your shoulder. "Knowing your limitations is its own form of strength. The Heartwood tested your humility as much as your potential."</p>

            <p>You return to Avalon with the Heartwood's leaf and a deep understanding that the best magic comes from knowing when to accept gifts and when to wait until you're truly ready to honor them.</p>

            <p>Your path continues - still learning, still growing, still seeking wisdom rather than rushing toward power.</p>

            <p>Other mages come to study what you've created. The glacier opens itself to them differently now - no longer just a testing ground, but a teacher that learned how to teach from you.</p>

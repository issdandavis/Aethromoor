# 🎉 Your Pull Request Help System is Ready!

Hi there! I've created a complete help system to manage your 84 pull requests. Here's what you need to know:

---

## 📍 Where to Start

**👉 Open this file first: [`PR_HELP_README.md`](PR_HELP_README.md)**

This will guide you through everything!

---

## 🤔 Quick Answers to Your Questions

### "What should I do with all these pull requests?"

**Answer:** Read `PULL_REQUEST_MANAGEMENT_GUIDE.md` - it has a complete decision framework and action plan.

### "I don't know when to push or pull"

**Answer:** Read `GIT_PUSH_PULL_GUIDE.md` - it has simple visual diagrams explaining:
- **PULL** = Download changes FROM GitHub ⬇️
- **PUSH** = Upload changes TO GitHub ⬆️

**The golden rule:** Always PULL before you PUSH!

### "How do I track my progress?"

**Answer:** Use `PR_CLEANUP_TRACKER.md` - it's already set up with all 84 PRs categorized and ready for you to check off.

**How to review them:**

### 3. Update Your Progress

## 🎯 Your Goal This Week

- [ ] Understand push vs pull
- [ ] Set up weekly PR review routine

## 💡 Key Concepts

### What is a Pull Request?
A PR is a proposal to merge changes into your main code. Think of it as a draft that hasn't been published yet.

### When Should I Merge?
✅ Merge when:
- Work is complete
- You've reviewed it
- It does something you want

### When Should I Close?
❌ Close when:
- It's outdated
- It's a duplicate
- You don't need it anymore

**Don't be afraid to close PRs!** It's better to have 20 well-managed PRs than 84 confusing ones.

---

## 🛠️ Tools Available

### Automated PR Categorization
I created a script that automatically categorizes your PRs:

```bash
# Run this to see all your PRs organized by type
bash scripts/categorize-prs.sh
```

**Note:** This requires GitHub CLI (`gh`). If you don't have it, you can still manage PRs through the web interface.

## 📞 Need More Help?

1. **Check the guides** - They cover almost everything
2. **GitHub Docs** - https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests
3. **Ask questions** - Create a GitHub Discussion in your repo

## 🔄 Standard Workflow Established

```
1. Lore Curator validates source → ✅ Approved
2. Conversion Engineer drafts scene → 🚧 Draft
3. Structural Reviewer verifies → ✅ Verified
4. Quality Balancer analyzes stats → ⚖️ Balanced
5. Final review and commit → 🎉 Complete
```

## 📋 Shared Context Artifacts

### Files All AIs Update
1. **STATUS_CONTEXT.md** - Session start/end
2. **SCENE_PARITY_CHECKLIST.md** - When scene status changes
3. **STATS_MATRIX.md** - When extracting stats

### Status Markers Used
- ✅ Verified - Complete and tested
- 🚧 Draft - Exists, needs verification
- 📝 Partial - Incomplete
- ❌ Missing - Not started
- ⏳ Pending - Waiting for review

---

## 🎯 How It Solves the Problem

### Before (Without System)
❌ AIs work in isolation  
❌ Duplicate work happens  
❌ Lore contradictions creep in  
❌ Stats become unbalanced  
❌ Progress hard to track  
❌ Knowledge lost between sessions  

### After (With System)
✅ AIs share context via tracked files  
✅ Work coordinated through checklists  
✅ Lore validated before implementation  
✅ Stats balanced systematically  
✅ Progress transparent to all  
✅ Seamless handoffs between sessions  

---

## 💡 Key Innovations

1. **Role-Based Specialization**
   - Each AI uses their strengths
   - Clear boundaries prevent overlap

2. **Shared Artifacts**
   - No knowledge silos
   - Real-time status visible to all

3. **Process Enforcement**
   - Checklists ensure quality
   - Workflow prevents shortcuts

4. **Lore Protection**
   - Consistency checked first, always
   - Canon preserved

5. **Balance Tracking**
